    "question_text": "Red tide is a form of harmful algae that releases toxins as it breaks down in the environment. A marine biologist is testing a new spray, composed of clay and water, hoping to kill the red tide that almost completely covers a beach in southern Florida. She applies the spray to a representative sample of 200 square feet of the beach. By the end of the week, 184 square feet of the beach is free of the red tide. Based on these results, and assuming the same general conditions, how many square feet of the 10,000-square-foot beach would still be covered by red tide if the spray had been used on the entire area?",

    "explanation": "A\nDifficulty:Medium\nCategory:Problem Solving and Data Analysis / Statistics and Probability\nGetting to the Answer:This is a science crossover question. Read the first two sentences quickly-they are simply describing the context of the question. The last two sentences pose the question, so read those more carefully. In the sample, 184 out of 200 square feet were free of red tide after applying the spray. This is184200=0.92=92%of the area. For the whole beach, 0.92(10,000) = 9,200 square feet should be free of the red tide. Be careful-this isnotthe answer. The question asks how much of the beach would still be covered by red tide, so subtract to get 10,000 - 9,200 = 800 square feet,(A)."

    "explanation": "C\nDifficulty:Medium\nCategory:Heart of Algebra / Linear Equations\nGetting to the Answer:Write your own equation using the initial cost and the rate of change in the value of the lawn mower. Remember: when something changes at a constant rate, it can be represented by a linear equation. When a linear equation in the formy=mx+bis used to model a real-world scenario,mrepresents the constant rate of change andbrepresents the starting amount. Here, the starting amount is easy-it's the purchase price, $2,800. To find the rate of change, think of the initial cost as the value at 0 years, or the point (0, 2,800), and the salvage amount as the value at 8 years, or the point (8, 240). Substitute these points into the slope formula:\nm=y2-y1x2-x1=240-2,8008-0=-2,5608=-320\nThe correct equation isy= -320x+ 2,800. This matches(C)."
