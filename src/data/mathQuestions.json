For example, you may always add the same number to each side, subtract the same number from each side, multiply or divide each side by the same number (except 0), square each side, take the square root of each side (if the quantities are positive), or take the reciprocal of each side. These comments apply to inequalities, as well, but here you must be very careful because some procedures, such as multiplying or dividing by a negative number and taking reciprocals, reverse inequalities (see KEY FACT A25)."

Also, since 8 of the players had an average of 79, they made a total of 8 Ã 79 = 632 baskets. The other 2 players, therefore, made 750 - 632 = 118 baskets. The most baskets that the player with the highest number could have made was 100, so the player with the lowest number had to have made at least 18."

To know where the pointer will be in 60 minutes, divide 60 by 7. Since the quotient is 8 and the remainder is 4, after 60 minutes the pointer will be pointing to the same number it pointed to after 4 minutes. Be careful. That number is not 3; it's 6. After 1 minute the pointer is at 4, after 2 minutes it's at 7, and so on.\nAlternative solution. Since the pointer advances 3 numbers per minute, it advances 3 Ã 60 = 180 minutes per hour. Dividing 180 by 7 gives a quotient of 25 and a remainder of 5, so the pointer makes 25 complete cycles and then advances 5 more numbers, from 1 to 6."

All the information you need is in the table. Use the formula Percent=partwholeÃ100%. To use the formula, find the part of the mass represented by the carbon; there is 1 mole of carbon and it has a mass of 12.011 grams. Next, find the whole mass of the mole of chloroform: 1 mole carbon (12.011 g) + 1 mole hydrogen (1.008 g) + 3 moles chlorine (3 Ã 35.453 g = 106.359 g) = 12.011g + 1.008 g + 106.359 g = 119.378 g. Now, use the formula:\nPercent=12.011119.378Ã100%=0.10061Ã100%=10.061%\nBefore you grid in your answer, make sure you follow the directions-round to the nearest whole percent, which is10."

From the previous question, you know that 1 mole of chloroform has a mass of 119.378 grams, so there are 477.5 Ã· 119.378 = 3.999, or about 4 moles of chloroform left. Be careful-you're not finished yet. The question asks for the number of moles ofchlorine, not chloroform. According to the table, each mole of chloroform contains 3 moles of chlorine, so there are 4 Ã 3 =12moles of chlorine left."
