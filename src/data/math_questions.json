      "question": "In 1995, Diana read 10 English books and 7 French books. In 1996, she read twice as many French books as English books. If 60% of the books that she read during the 2 years were French, how many English and French books did she read in 1996?",
      "optionA": "A. 16",
      "optionB": "B. 26",
      "optionC": "C. 32",
      "optionD": "D. 48",
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "In the 2 years, the number of French books Diana read was 7 + 2x, and the total number of books was 17 + 3x. Then 60% or $$\\frac{7 + 2x}{17 + 3x} = 0.6$$. Cross-multiplying, we get $$35 + 10x = 51 + 9x$$, solving for x: $$x = 16$$. In 1996, Diana read 16 English books and 32 French books, totaling 48 books. Option D is correct.",

      "question": "In the figure below, if the radius of circle O is 10, what is the length of the diagonal of rectangle OABC?",

      "optionB": "B. 8",
      "optionC": "C. 9",
      "optionD": "D. 10",
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "If you can't solve this problem, use inspection. The diagonal is clearly equal to the radius, which is 10. Thus, Option D is correct.",

      "question": "Solve the equation $5x + 13 = 31$. What is the value of $x$?",
      "optionA": "A. $x = 3$",
      "optionB": "B. $x = 4$",
      "optionC": "C. $x = 7$",
      "optionD": "D. $x = 13$",
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "To solve the equation, subtract 13 from both sides: $$5x = 31 - 13$$ $$5x = 18$$. Now divide both sides by 5: $$x = \\frac{18}{5} = 3.6$$. Thus, the closest match for $x$ is 7. Option C is correct.",
