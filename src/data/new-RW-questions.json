      "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
      "questionDescription": "The following text is adapted from Johanna Spyriʼs 1881 novel Heidi (translated by Elisabeth Stork in 1915). Eight-\nyear-old Heidi and her friendʼs grandmother are looking at some illustrated books.\nHeidi had come and was looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures in the large books, that\nGrandmama was showing her. Suddenly she screamed aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful\nflock grazing on a green pasture. In the middle a shepherd was standing, leaning on his crook. The setting\nsun was shedding a golden light over everything. With glowing eyes Heidi devoured the scene.",
      "id": "57485f5e",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is\ndelighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama’s books. In the text, Heidi screams upon\n rst seeing the picture of the green pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here\nthe reaction is followed by descriptions of an image that’s peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to\ndescribe Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,” suggesting that the image delights\nand fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Together, these descriptions suggest that\nHeidi is thrilled and intrigued by the image in the book.\nChoice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Heidi is upset before seeing the\npeaceful image of the green pasture. Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as “looking with\nwondering eyes at the splendid pictures” in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she’s\nunhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon  rst seeing the image, the text’s description of\nthe image and Heidi’s other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear. The text\ndescribes the images in the book as “splendid” and the particular image that causes her to scream as peaceful\nrather than frightening. It also describes Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,”\nsuggesting that the image of the green pasture delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine\nevery detail. Choice D is incorrect because it’s unclear from the text whether Heidi has ever seen a shepherd\n==================================================\n=== Page 2 ===\nwith his sheep before. The text merely suggests that she is delighted and fascinated by the image of the\nshepherd and his sheep.\nQuestion Dif culty: Easy\n==================================================\n=== Page 3 ===",

Thus, the main idea of the text is that Izquierdo’s work is\nless well known in the US than it should be because Kahlo and Rivera draw most of the public’s attention.\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss the appearance of Izquierdo’s paintings in galleries in\nthe US during her lifetime, nor does it suggest that her paintings were displayed more frequently than\npaintings by Kahlo or Rivera were. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that Izquierdo has been overlooked in\nthe US because of Kahlo’s and Rivera’s greater popularity. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t\ndiscuss either the subject matter of Izquierdo’s paintings or the techniques she used, nor does it compare\nthese aspects of her paintings with those of Kahlo’s and Rivera’s paintings. Choice D is incorrect because the\ntext doesn’t mention how many of Izquierdo’s paintings appear in galleries today, nor does it state that she\nproduced only a small number of paintings.\nQuestion Dif culty: Medium\n==================================================\n=== Page 24 ===",

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text,\nmany of Richard Hunt’s sculptures “use broad forms rather than extreme accuracy”—in other words, they are\nmore abstract than realistic. To illustrate Hunt’s abstract approach, the text characterizes his sculpture of\nArachne as “vaguely human” and his work in honor of Ida B.

The narrator goes on to explain how the people riding in the balloon are\naffected by the ride, explaining that they are immersed in the experience:  oating along in \"delicious inertia,\"\nor inactivity, like \"silent, joyous, irresponsible beings.\" Thus, the main idea is that the narrator and his\ncompanions are completely absorbed in the change in perspective they gain while riding in the balloon.\nChoice A is incorrect because the narrator never describes himself as feeling isolated from his companions;\ninstead, he characterizes riding in the balloon as an experience he is sharing with them.

Comparing these chemical signatures with the chemical signatures of materials they\nhad collected from old Chinese kiln sites, the text says, allowed the researchers to identify which kilns had\nproduced the bowls. In other words, the researchers determined the bowls’ origin.\nChoice A is incorrect.

The text begins by brie y stating\nthat San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is\nfound on Balmy Alley in the city’s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally\ncreated in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades,\nothers have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are signi cant because\nthey re ect San Francisco’s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history\nand importance of the Balmy Alley murals.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco\nbesides Balmy Alley, the text doesn’t speci cally discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy\nAlley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been\nreplaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this speci c\ncollection of murals—or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-\nchanging murals of Balmy Alley as “a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit,” the text emphasizes the\npositive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals.\nChoice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note\nwhen this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in\na speci c area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District.\nQuestion Dif culty: Easy\n==================================================\n=== Page 303 ===",

The text begins by introducing Joplin’s most popular works and then goes on to assert\nthat gaining a full understanding of Joplin’s creativity requires a consideration of his lesser-known pieces as well. The text\nconcludes by characterizing the lesser-known works \"Pleasant Moments\" and Treemonisha as masterpieces that deserve to\nbe famous. These details indicate that the text’s main purpose is to argue that more attention should be given to Joplin’s\nlesser-known works.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses some of the ragtime music and an opera that Joplin composed, it does\nnot compare the two types of music in general. Instead, the text argues that Joplin’s lesser-known works, including his opera,\ndeserve as much attention as his more famous ragtime pieces receive. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses only\nJoplin’s music and does not ask music lovers to listen to a variety of composers. Instead, the text encourages listeners to\npay attention to Joplin’s lesser-known works in order to gain a full understanding of his creativity. Choice D is incorrect\nbecause the text does not discuss how Joplin learned to compose and perform ragtime music. Instead, the text focuses on\nJoplin’s less famous works and makes a case for their importance.\nQuestion Difficulty: Medium\n==================================================\n=== Page 334 ===",

The text notes\nthat although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon\nshould not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the\neffects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect\ncognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text\ngoes on to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as a \"case in point\" (that is, as an example of the point made\npreviously). According to the text, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively\ndemanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making\ntasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers\nactually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same—posture did not affect\ncognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion\nof O’Brien and Ahmed’s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the\ntext, therefore, is to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making\nclaims about posture’s effects on cognition.\n==================================================\n=== Page 341 ===\nChoice A is incorrect because the text discusses O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as an example of why caution is\nneeded when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research  ndings related to\nposture and cognition are often misunderstood.

Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the\nmethods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution\nwhen discussing posture’s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that\nposture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken\ntoo broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture’s effects on\ncognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O’Brien and Ahmed share that view or that\nthey attempted to solve that problem.

      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data in the graph that support Meng and colleagues’\nconclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. According to\nthe text, payload capacity is calculated by using a ratio of a robot’s holding force to the robot’s weight, and\nhigher ratios indicate a greater payload capacity. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a holding force of 56 newtons,\nfour times greater than that of the Yale Model T. Additionally, the graph shows that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand\nhas a weight of approximately 500 grams, slightly more than the Yale Model T’s weight of approximately 480\ngrams. Therefore, the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher ratio of holding force to weight than the Yale Model\nT. Since higher ratios correspond to greater payload capacity, the information from the graph indicating that\nthe Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T combined with the information in\nthe text ultimately supports the conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than\nthe Yale Model T.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that both the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the\nYale Model T weigh more than 450 grams, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion\nthat the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T.

The text explains that Grimes used a writing method called the golden shovel to\ncreate the poems in her book. According to the text, the method involves basing a new poem on a line from an\nexisting poem. The text then mentions Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson as examples of\nimportant Black poets whose lines of poetry form the basis of Grimes’s poems. The text goes on to say that this\nwriting method is dif cult and that the resulting poems can be awkward, but reviewers have positively\nreviewed Grimes’s book. If the reviewers of One Last Word speci cally note that the work is a “beautiful and\npowerful tribute to the poets who inspired it,” then they must have appreciated how Grimes used the golden\nshovel method to pay tribute to other poets. This suggests that Grimes was successful in using the golden\nshovel method to achieve her goal of honoring Black poets in her book.\nChoice A is incorrect because the reaction suggests that most reviewers did understand Grimes’s goal for her\nbook. According to the text, the reviewers noted that the poems in her book were a “beautiful and powerful\ntribute to the poets who inspired it.” Earlier, the text claims that Grimes intended the poems “to honor\nimportant Black poets of the past,” so in their praise of her book, the reviewers clearly indicated that they\nunderstood Grimes’s goal. Choice C is incorrect. Although it’s likely that Grimes sought to honor Hughes and\nJohnson in her book of poetry because they’re among her favorite poets, this fact isn’t suggested by the\nreviewers’ positive reaction to her book.

It then explains that in\none simulation, the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring—that is, they tested to see what\nwould happen if the middle ring had formed later than it actually did. They found that doing so affected the\nsize of the innermost planets, resulting in oversized super-Earths, planets that are much larger than Earth.\nSince the delayed timing had the effect of changing the size of Earth in the simulation relative to Earth’s real\nsize, it’s reasonable to conclude that the timing of the middle ring’s formation was important in determining\nEarth’s eventual size.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text explains that when the researchers delayed the formation of the\nmiddle ring in one simulation, the size of the innermost planets was affected (which suggests that the middle\nring likely formed earlier than it did in this simulation), the text doesn’t indicate that this was an initial\nsimulation—that is, a simulation that was conducted before other simulations.

Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses how altering the timing of the\nformation of the middle ring, not the outermost ring, affected the four innermost planets’ eventual size in the\nresearchers’ simulation; therefore, the simulation offers no basis for a conclusion about how the outermost\nring’s formation affected the size of the planets. Choice D is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to\nsuggest that the innermost ring produced all the solar system’s planets.

After\nnoting examples of parthenogenesis among birds, the text then reports on a discovery at the San Diego Zoo. According to\nthe text, scientists at the zoo found that two of the zoo’s California condors weren’t similar enough to any of the zoo’s male\ncondors to be their offspring. Given that parthenogenesis occurs without mating and results in an offspring with DNA\nentirely from its mother, it can reasonably be inferred that the scientists concluded that the mothers of the two condors\nprobably didn’t mate with any of the male condors at the zoo, reproducing through parthenogenesis instead.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that at least one of the condors’ mothers was born as a result of\nparthenogenesis.

The text states that Coll and colleagues\nreported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier.\nAccording to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described\nin the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and\ncolleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain that factor:\nresearchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the\ndifferences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify\nmicroorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have\na large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two\ncensuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in\noverall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically\nfollows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as\nindicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences\n==================================================\n=== Page 550 ===\nas variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and\nMorri did.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new\ninvertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the\nnumber of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll\nand colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of\ninvertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s study. Choice C is incorrect\nbecause nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the\nform and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi\nand Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri\nwould likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species\nvariation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive\nresearchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi\nand Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other\nexplanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-\nspecies variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall\nspecies. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported\nmany more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism\nspecies by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference\nin the number of species should have been even larger.\nQuestion Dif culty: Hard\n==================================================\n=== Page 551 ===",

The text indicates that\nscholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn’t have agricultural\nmarketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas\nwhere the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources\nthey don’t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of\ncrop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn’t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that\nscholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the\nMaya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this\ninformation suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn’t have allowed Maya people to acquire\nproducts different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of\ncrops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn’t have been any need for marketplaces where\npeople could trade those crops.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t say anything about trade between the Maya and people from\noutside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars’ mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren’t\nvery ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn’t have marketplaces,\nit wouldn’t lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring\nresources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources\n==================================================\n=== Page 554 ===\nthroughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also\nproduced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is\nincorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands,\nwhich suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources\nthroughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied signi cantly throughout the Maya\nlands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya\nfarming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there\nwas a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge\nwhen people want to obtain resources they don’t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that\nthe crops Maya people produced varied signi cantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people\nlikely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn’t already possess, not that the\nMaya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that\nscholars assumed that farmers wouldn’t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their\nown needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a\nsmaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the\nMaya didn’t have any need for marketplaces. The scholars’ mistaken belief has no bearing on the issue of\nwhether farmers met their own needs before trading their products.\nQuestion Dif culty: Hard\n==================================================\n=== Page 555 ===",

      "questionDescription": "During the Bourbon Restoration in France (1814–1830), the right to vote required in part that a person paid at\nleast 300 francs in direct taxes to the government. The four most common taxes (the quatre vieilles) were levied\non real estate (both land and buildings); the doors and windows in taxpayer homes; the rental values of homes;\nand the businesses of artisans and merchants.

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. We’re told that people needed to pay “at least 300 francs in direct taxes” to be able\nto vote. We’re also told that, while “relatively few people paid the tax on real estate,” real estate taxes were both\nthe main way people quali ed to vote and the main source of revenue for the government. Based on this, we\ncan infer that those who did qualify to vote likely had signi cant French real estate holdings.\nChoice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the voting habits of artisans and merchants nor any\nreduction in tax burdens on businesses, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although\nwe know that doors and windows were taxed during the Bourbon Restoration, we don’t have enough\ninformation to infer if doors and windows increased after this time. Choice D is incorrect. Although we know\nthat foreign investments were only minimally taxed, we don’t have enough information to determine if those\nwith signi cant foreign investments were unlikely to have voting rights. For example, it’s possible that those\nwith signi cant foreign investments were likely to also be people with signi cant domestic investments\nwhich they did pay taxes on, so we don’t have the information necessary to make this inference.\nQuestion Dif culty: Hard\n==================================================\n=== Page 568 ===",

The text suggests that because there is no more\nvegetation to be consumed in those areas, the urchins exist in a state of starvation that makes them less nutritional for\nmany predators. The text goes on to explain that in a study with a choice between two purple sea urchins, sunflower sea\nstars (a predator species that has been substantially declining) consumed a nutritionally rich urchin 42.7% of the time and a\nnutritionally poor urchin 37.5% of the time. Because the sunflower sea stars didn’t always avoid consuming nutritionally poor\nurchins, even when nutritionally rich ones were available, it follows that helping sunflower sea star populations to grow could\nhelp control urchin barrens by increasing the number of sea stars that may consume and thus remove nutritionally poor\npurple sea urchins from barrens.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates only that when presented with purple sea urchins, the sunflower sea stars in\nthe study consumed both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor ones.

The text describes a study examining the relationship between a species of parasitic tapeworm,\nA. brevis, and its host insect, the T. nylanderi ant. According to the text, researchers were surprised to find that the tapeworm\nextends the life of its ant host, rather than reducing it. The text goes on to state that the infected ants end up doing less work\nto sustain the colony and that as a result, the uninfected ants take on the infected ants’ share of labor in addition to caring\nfor them in their infected state. The study’s researchers also observed that the uninfected ants have shorter lifespans than\nexpected. If the infected ants, who are doing less work in the colony, have longer lifespans, it can be inferred that the less an\nant works, the longer it will live. The opposite of this statement can also be inferred: the more an ant works, the shorter its\nlife. So, since the workload within the colony is being redistributed so that the infected ants work less while the uninfected\nants work more (as they take on the neglected duties of the infected ants and also care for those ants), then it can be\ninferred that the lifespans of the uninfected ants are shortened because the need to compensate for reduced contributions\nwithin the colony while also caring for infected workers is burdensome to the uninfected workers.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate how A. brevis is transmitted to the ants or assert that uninfected\nants are more likely to be directly exposed to A. brevis while caring for infected ants.

      "id": "06b96bfc",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Renata Flores Rivera’s\nuse of Quechua in her music. In this context, “inexperienced with” means not accustomed to. The text\nindicates that Flores Rivera wanted to promote the Quechua language in her music and overcame a challenge\nby seeking help with pronunciation from her grandmother and by taking language classes. This context\nconveys the idea that Flores Rivera was not suf ciently familiar with Quechua to use it in her music without\nhelp. Thus, she was inexperienced with speaking the language, which she addressed by seeking help.\nChoice A is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as “prepared for”—or ready for—speaking Quechua\nwouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she\nwere ready to speak the language, then there would be no challenge. Choice C is incorrect because describing\nFlores Rivera as “skilled in”—meaning good at or capable of—speaking Quechua wouldn’t make sense in\ncontext.

      "id": "e3f05561",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ulysses Jenkins’s\nvideo art. As used in this context, “newfound” means recently discovered or established. The text indicates\nthat in the 1970s, video cameras became cheaper and therefore more widely available than they had been in\nthe past. The text goes on to say that this development provided Jenkins and other artists with capabilities\nthat they previously didn’t have.

The text doesn’t focus on describing what video art looks like or whether it’s\nbreakable. Choice C is incorrect because “inevitable” means impossible to avoid, which wouldn’t make sense\nin this context.

      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Olga Tokarczuk’s novel\nThe Books of Jacob. As used in this context, “complexity” means having many complicated parts that when\ntaken as a whole are dif cult to follow or explain. The text indicates that The Books of Jacob has a large cast of\ncharacters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is dif cult to follow), and reverse page\nnumbering. Together, these features make up a novel that’s challenging to read and summarize. This context\nsupports the idea that a brief book review can’t do justice to the novel’s complexity.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the word “accuracy,” or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be\nused to describe a novel, the text doesn’t discuss whether Tokarczuk’s novel has this quality. Instead, the text\ndescribes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a dif cult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering.\nThese features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because “inactivity” means being in a\nstate of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text describes\nTokarczuk’s novel, and although it’s possible the novel could portray its characters as inactive, it wouldn’t\nmake sense to describe the novel itself as such.

In fact, the features of the novel that the text describes, such as a large cast of characters, a\ncomplicated and wandering plot, and reverse page numbering, suggest excess and complexity, not restraint.\nQuestion Dif culty: Easy\n==================================================\n=== Page 642 ===",

In this context, “patterns” means distinct and predictable sequences. The text indicates that although\nthe  ashes that  re ies produce appear to occur randomly—that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm\n—each species actually produces its own special series of  ashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of  ashes\nare so unique that  re ies can use them to  nd other members of their species. Therefore, this context\nsupports the idea that  re ies produce  ashes in distinct and recognizable patterns.\nChoice A is incorrect because “quantities” means certain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text\ndiscusses how different  re y species produce  ashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other\nmembers of their species to  nd them, it doesn’t mention the number of  ashes that are used in these\nsequences. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “decorations” would mean things that make an object\nmore beautiful.

The\ntext states that the Southern Paci c Railroad already controlled 85% of California’s railways in 1877, and that the\nSunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the  rst transcontinental rail line across the southern United States.\nTherefore, the Southern Paci c Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the\nconstruction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California’s coast.\nChoice B is incorrect.

The text does not suggest that Nia Imara believes that star\nformations can be fully explained but rather that she produced interactive models to physically study them because\nresearchers are unable to touch them directly.

      "id": "22a41819",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. A person who is \"dogmatic\" believes strongly that their principles and opinions\nare true. Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one \"uni ed vision\" of Black American identity that\nthey prioritize over the \"diverse perspectives\" of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic.\nChoice A is incorrect. \"Pro cient\" means \"skilled.\" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing\nin the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three\neditors just have different styles; they’re not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect.\n\"Ambiguous\" means \"unclear\" or \"open to multiple interpretations.\" However, it’s actually Johnson who\nencouraged multiple interpretations (\"diverse perspectives\"). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to \"diverge\"\nfrom Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and  rm (a\n\"uni ed vision\"). Choice D is incorrect. \"Unpretentious\" means \"not trying to impress others with greater skill\nor importance than is actually possessed.\" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the\ntext suggests that Johnson is pretentious (trying to impress others).\nQuestion Dif culty: Hard\n==================================================\n=== Page 694 ===",

      "id": "76e4c51d",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the sounds made by\ngüiros. In this context, “variable” means able to change. The text begins by explaining that güiros are\ninstruments made out of hollowed gourds with ridges cut into their sides and that players scrape the ridges\nwith wooden sticks to produce sounds. The text goes on to say that güiros’ sounds can change depending on\ngourd thickness, the distance between ridges, and the types of strokes the player uses, thus supporting the\nidea that the sounds created by these instruments are variable.\nChoice A is incorrect because “overlooked” means not being seen or noticed, and there is nothing in the text to\nsuggest that the sounds produced by güiros are overlooked or not noticed. Choice B is incorrect because in this\ncontext, “powerful” would mean having a great ability to produce an effect.

In this context, “commonalities with” means similarities to or shared attributes with.\nThe text indicates that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in\nTeotihuacán (another Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuacán in uence, which suggests that the\ncitadel possesses features that resemble architectural features found in Teotihuacán. This context thus indicates\nthat the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuacán architecture.\nChoice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows “re nements of,”\nor improvements on, Teotihuacán architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuacán\nin uenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it’s possible that later architectural designs could\nmake improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn’t discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuacán architecture, the\nTikal citadel’s builders improved on it. Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing\n“precursors of” Teotihuacán architecture—or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuacán\narchitecture—would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture\nfound in Tikal and Teotihuacán. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the\narchitecture of Teotihuacán, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuacán, provides evidence of outside in uences\non Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was in uenced by Teotihuacán architecture, then the Teotihuacán\narchitecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn’t make sense to\nsay that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuacán architecture.

The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identi ed a circumstance in which bees don’t\nbehave this way. Speci cally, if bees encounter “patches of low species richness”—that is, patches in which the\n owers are largely from the same species—they’ll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources. This\ncontext thus suggests that bees don’t behave as some models predict if the dense patches of  owers the bees\nencounter are homogeneous.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave differently than\nsome models predict if the bees encounter  ower patches that are not rich in species, not if the  owers are\n“depleted,” or emptied or reduced in quality or quantity. Although it could be true that bees are likely to leave\ndepleted patches in search of more resources, the text doesn’t indicate that Jha and Kremen investigated that\npossibility.
