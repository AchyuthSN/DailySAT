No punctuation is needed between the proper noun “Heather Grab” and “entomologist,” the title that describes Grab. Additionally, no punctuation is needed between the sentence’s subject (“Entomologist Heather Grab”) and the main verb (“found”) that indicates what Grab did. Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb. Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed.

    optionC: "C. commercial plastics’ two associated problems are that",
    optionD: "D. commercial plastics have two associated problems:",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modier placement. This choice ensures that the modifying phrase “despite being cheap, versatile, and easy to produce” appears immediately before the noun it modies, “commercial plastics,” clearly establishing that the commercial plastics—and not another noun in the sentence—are being described as cheap, versatile, and easy to produce. Choice A is incorrect because it results in a dangling modier. The placement of the function word “there” immediately after the modifying phrase illogically and confusingly suggests that “there” is cheap, versatile, and easy to produce.

    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase “the activists” the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase “after...legislation.” In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that the activists—and not another noun in the sentence—were pleading for the passage of antidiscrimination legislation. Choice A is incorrect because it results in a dangling modier. The placement of the noun phrase “pressure on lawmakers” immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the “pressure” was pleading for the passage of antidiscrimination legislation. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modier.

    optionB: "B. had measured",
    optionC: "C. would have measured",

      'Choice A is the best answer. The previous sentence tells us how economists in India "use" a certain tool, while this sentence describes general facts about that tool. To express general facts (and also to match the simple present tense of "use"), we should use the simple present tense form "measures." Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses the past perfect tense, but the previous sentence tells us that the tool is currently used to measure things, so the past tense doesn’t make sense for this verb. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses the future perfect conditional tense, but the previous sentence tells us that the tool is currently used to measure things, so the future tense doesn’t make sense for this verb.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of a supplementary element within a sentence. The comma after “nutrients” pairs with the comma after “photosynthesis” to separate the supplementary element “the mechanism by which plants use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into nutrients” from the rest of the sentence. This supplementary element functions to dene the term “photosynthesis,” and the pair of commas indicates that this element could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence. Choice A is incorrect because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence. Choice B is incorrect because a conjunction can’t be paired with a comma in this way to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence. Choice D is incorrect because a dash can’t be paired with a comma in this way to separate the supplementary element from the rest of the sentence.",

This choice correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction “but” to join the rst main clause (“Human-made...bers”) and the second main clause (“the manufacture...water”).

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase "the researchers" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase "knowing…day." In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that the researchers—and not another noun in the sentence—know that ying insects keep their backs pointed toward sunlight during the day. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modier. The placement of the noun phrase "the researchers’ theory" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the researchers’ theory knows that ying insects keep their backs pointed toward sunlight during the day. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modier. The placement of the noun "moths" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that moths know that ying insects keep their backs pointed toward sunlight during the day.

In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (“Defying…fast”) and another sentence that begins with a supplementary phrase (“During…Olympics”). Choice A is incorrect. When a dash is present in a sentence (“ran—fast”), it’s not conventional to use another dash (“fast—during”) to mark the boundary between sentences because it creates a potentially confusing sentence.

    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of elements in a complex series. It’s conventional to use a semicolon to separate items in a complex series with internal punctuation, and in this choice, the semicolon after "leaves" is conventionally used to separate the rst item ("natural debris, such as dried leaves") and the second item ("man-made trash, such as plastic bags") in the series of materials used by Gavua. Further, the comma after "trash" correctly separates the noun phrase "man-made trash" from the supplementary phrase ("such as plastic bags") that describes it. Choice A is incorrect because a comma after "leaves" doesn’t match the semicolon used later to separate the second and third items in the series ("manmade...bags" and "and...glue"). Additionally, it’s not conventional to use a colon in this way to separate a supplementary phrase ("such as plastic bags") from the noun phrase it modies ("man-made trash"). Choice C is incorrect because a comma after "leaves" doesn’t match the semicolon used later to separate the second and third items in the series ("man-made...bags" and "and...glue").

Furthermore, the dash after "sculptures" pairs with the dash after "photographs" to separate these two supplementary elements from the rest of the sentence. The pair of dashes, which operate at a higher organizing level than the comma, indicates that the elements between the dashes function together—in this case, the second supplement ("from…sculptures") describes the range of items mentioned in the rst supplement—and could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.

      'Choice D is the best answer. The independent clauses "researcher Lin Zhi…silk" and "by dissolving…2 GPa" can be grammatically separated by a period. They can stand alone as sentences, and this is the only choice that lets them do that. Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error called a comma splice.

      "Choice C is the best answer. The clause “A subseasonal…advance” and the clause “its predictions…forecast” are both independent clauses, so using a semicolon to separate them is grammatically correct. Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause “A subseasonal…advance” and the clause “its predictions…forecast” are both independent clauses, so a comma is not enough to separate them. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause “A subseasonal… advance” and the clause “its predictions…forecast” are both independent clauses, so they need to be separated with specic punctuation (a period, a semi-colon, a colon, a dash, or a comma + a coordinating conjunction).

    correctAnswer: 0,

The nonnite to-innitive “to forge” is correctly used to form a nonnite (innitive) clause that explains why the chemists re-created and reprogrammed the DNA-cleaving bacteria. Choice B is incorrect. Without a comma separating the main clause (“chemists...bacteria”) from the participle “forging,” this choice illogically suggests that the bacteria are forging a tool, which doesn’t make sense. Choice C is incorrect. Without a coordinating conjunction such as “and” placed before it, the nite past tense verb “forged” can’t be used in this way to describe the chemists’ actions. Choice D is incorrect. If read as a nite verb, the present progressive verb “forging” isn’t consistent with the past tense verbs used in this sentence to describe the actions of the chemists.

    optionD: "D. temperature by adding",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between the rst sentence (“On…temperature”) and the second sentence (“Adding…effect”). The gerund phrase beginning with “adding” is the subject of the second sentence, and the verb phrase “helps combat this effect” describes what adding a light-colored covering can do. Choice A is incorrect because a semicolon can’t be used in this way to join the sentence “On...temperature” and the supplementary phrases that follow. Doing so leaves the verb phrase “helps combat” without a subject and thus results in a grammatically unconventional sentence. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests that adding a light-colored covering to an existing dark roof raises the temperature of the surrounding air.

      "On November 2, 1772, amid rising tensions with Great Britain, Boston colonists formed the Boston Committee of Correspondence. By 1774, what had started as a local means of mobilizing support for the Patriot cause had grown into something far more ______ network of such committees that, facilitating communication among the colonies, helped lay the groundwork for the Continental Congress. Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?",
    optionA: "A. extensive: a",
    optionB: "B. extensive; a",
    optionC: "C. extensive, it was a",
    optionD: "D. extensive. A",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of a colon within a sentence. In this choice, the colon is correctly used to introduce the following explanation of what the Patriot cause had grown into by 1774. Choice B is incorrect because a semicolon can’t be used in this way to join the main clause ("what…extensive") and the supplementary element ("a network… Congress"). A semicolon is conventionally used to join two main clauses, whereas a colon is conventionally used to introduce an element that explains or amplies the information in the preceding clause, making the colon the better choice in this context. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. The addition of the pronoun and verb "it was" forms the start of a new main clause in the sentence, and a comma can’t be used in this way to mark the boundary between two main clauses. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with "a network."',

The comma after “that” pairs with the comma after “roles” to separate the supplementary element “among their many roles” from the rest of the sentence. This supplementary element functions to clarify that polyphenols have many roles, and the pair of commas indicates that this element could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. The phrase “according to Swentzell” is an aside that interrupts the ow of the sentence, so it needs to be separated from the sentence with a pair of matching punctuation marks: two commas, two dashes, or a pair of parentheses. We already have a comma before “according,” so we must add a comma after “Swentzell.” . Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. The phrase “according to Swentzell” is an aside that interrupts the ow of the sentence, so it needs to be separated from the sentence with a pair of matching punctuation marks: one before and one after the phrase. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. “The arrangement of the gures, according to Swentzell” is not an independent clause, so it can’t come before a colon. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. The phrase “according to Swentzell” is an aside that interrupts the ow of the sentence, so it needs to be separated from the sentence with a pair of matching punctuation marks.

    optionB: "B. offense, according",
    optionC: "C. offense according",
    optionD: "D. offense and according",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. “Nine months…offense” and “according to…system” are both independent clauses. Separating them with a period and turning them into their own sentences is the only grammatically correct choice among the provided options. Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a comma splice error, which is a punctuation error that occurs when two independent clauses are joined by only a comma. “Nine months…offense” and “according to…system” are both independent clauses, so they need to be either joined by a semicolon, joined by a comma and a coordinating conjunction, or separated by a period. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence, which occurs when two independent clauses are joined without punctuation. “Nine months…offense” and “according to…system” are both independent clauses, so they need to be either joined by a semicolon, joined by a comma and a coordinating conjunction, or separated by a period. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence, which occurs when two independent clauses are joined without punctuation. “Nine months…offense” and “according to…system” are independent clauses, so we would need to put a comma before the coordinating conjunction “and” to join them properly.",

    optionB: "B. adjustments, prior",
    optionC: "C. adjustments. Prior",
    optionD: "D. adjustments and prior",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between the rst sentence (“The...adjustments”) and the second sentence (“Prior...days”). Because the adverbial phrase beginning with “prior” indicates when changing a spreadsheet required redoing the sheet by hand, that phrase belongs with the second sentence. Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. Two sentences are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice.

    optionB: "B. ones even so,",
    optionC: "C. ones; even so,",
    optionD: "D. ones, even so,",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice uses a semicolon in a conventional way to join the rst main clause (“It is…ones”) and the second main clause (“even so…needs”). Furthermore, the placement of the semicolon after “ones” indicates that the supplementary phrase “even so” modies the following clause (“the reawakening...needs”), resulting in the most logical and grammatically complete sentence. With this punctuation, the sentence logically indicates that the recent interest in an old technology like steam engines is despite the fact that technological change typically seeks out new technologies. Choice A is incorrect because it results in a confusing and illogical sentence. Placing the semicolon after “so” indicates that the supplementary element “even so” modies the rst clause of the sentence, which doesn’t make sense in this context. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. It fails to mark the boundary between the two main clauses with appropriate punctuation.

The supplementary element “according to reviewers” modies the main clause of the second sentence (“the Toledos’...culture”). Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence.

The plural noun "jugglers" and the plural possessive determiner "their" correctly indicate that there are multiple jugglers whose motion is being discussed. Choice A is incorrect because the context requires the plural noun "jugglers" and the plural possessive determiner "their," not the plural possessive noun "jugglers’" and the contraction "they’re."

      "D. the alkaloid physostigmine was synthesized by Julian in 1935 and",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase “Julian’s 1935 synthesis” the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase “named…years.” In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that Julian’s 1935 synthesis of the alkaloid physostigmine—and not another noun in the sentence—was named in 1999 as one of the greatest achievements by a US chemist in the past hundred years. Choice A is incorrect because it results in a dangling modier. The placement of the noun “Julian” immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that Julian himself was named as one of the greatest achievements by a US chemist in the past hundred years. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modier. The placement of the prepositional phrase “in 1935” immediately after the modifying phrase illogically and confusingly suggests that “in 1935” was named as one of the greatest achievements by a US chemist in the past hundred years.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of items in a complex series (a series including internal punctuation). The semicolon after “nonnative” is correctly used to separate the rst item (“growing diverse plant species, both native and nonnative”) and the second item (“fostering scientic research”) in the series of things that botanical gardens are dedicated to.

    optionB: "B. was",
    optionC: "C. is",
    optionD: "D. will be",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense in a sentence. In this choice, the past tense verb "was," used in conjunction with the prepositional phrase "from outside the United States," correctly indicates that in the 1860s nearly 30% of the population in Los Angeles wasn’t from the US. Choice A is incorrect because the present progressive tense verb "is being" doesn’t indicate that the claim about Los Angeles’s population refers to the population back in the 1860s. Choice C is incorrect because the present tense verb "is" doesn’t indicate that the claim about Los Angeles’s population refers to the population back in the 1860s. Choice D is incorrect because the future tense verb "will be" doesn’t indicate that the claim about Los Angeles’s population refers to the population back in the 1860s.',

In this choice, the period after “congurations” is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (“The intense…congurations”) and another (“TMAO…sh”). The supplementary phrase (“ensuring…congurations”) modies the main clause of the rst sentence (“The chemical…effect”), and “TMAO” is the subject of the second sentence.

    optionC: "C. to serve",
    optionD: "D. serving",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. A main clause requires a nite (tensed) verb to perform the action of the subject (in this case, "multiple newspapers"), and this choice supplies the nite present tense verb "serve" to indicate that there are multiple newspapers serving the Spanish-speaking population of Washington, DC. Choice B is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonnite participle "having served" doesn’t supply the main clause with a nite verb. Choice C is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonnite to-innitive "to serve" doesn’t supply the main clause with a nite verb.

    optionB: "B. movement, which",
    optionC: "C. movement which",
    optionD: "D. movement. Which",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. This choice correctly uses commas to set off the nonessential relative clause "which is known as Brownian motion" that provides extra information about the "random, continuous movement" that isn’t necessary for the function of the sentence. Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. The relative clause "which is known as Brownian motion" is a nonessential supplement. Nonessential supplements need to be set apart from the rest of the sentence with a pair of commas, dashes, or parentheses, so we can’t use a colon here. Also, notice that colons can only come after an independent clause, which isn’t the case here. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. The relative clause "which is known as Brownian motion" is a nonessential supplement, so it should be separated from the rest of the sentence by a pair of matching punctuation marks. We already have a comma after "motion," so we need to add a comma before "which." This choice is missing that comma. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence fragment. "This type of random, continuous movement" is not an independent clause and can’t stand alone as a full sentence, so we can’t put a period here.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. Subject-modier placement requires a modier and its subject to be next to each other. The subject of the modier "a coming-of-age story…colonialism" is Chraïbi’s novel The Simple Past, so the subject "Chraïbi’s debut novel" ts perfectly after this introductory modifying phrase. Choice A is incorrect. Modiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The introductory modier "a coming-of-age story…colonialism" is describing Chraïbi’s novel, not Morocco. However, this choice places Morocco directly next to that modier. Choice C is incorrect. Modiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The introductory modier "a coming-of-age story…colonialism" all describes Chraïbi’s novel, not Chraïbi himself. However, this choice places Chraïbi directly next to that modier. Choice D is incorrect. Modiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modier "a coming-of-age story…" is describing Chraïbi’s novel, so that needs to be the subject immediately after the modier. This choice adds another modier that describes Chraïbi’s novel, but then puts "Chraïbi" himself—not the novel—right after that modier, which doesn’t make sense.

    optionB:
      "B. silica glass has a more dispersed atomic arrangement, resulting in a signicant disadvantage:",
    optionC:
      "C. a signicant disadvantage of silica glass is that its atomic arrangement is more dispersed:",
    optionD:
      "D. silica glass’s atomic arrangement is more dispersed, resulting in a signicant disadvantage:",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modier placement. This choice makes “silica glass’s atomic arrangement” the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase “compared to that of alumina glass.” In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that silica glass’s atomic arrangement—and not another noun in the sentence—is being compared to the atomic arrangement (“that”) of alumina glass. Choice A is incorrect because it results in a dangling modier. The placement of the noun phrase “silica glass” immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that silica glass itself (rather than its atomic arrangement) is being compared to alumina glass’s atomic arrangement. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modier. The placement of the noun phrase “silica glass” immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that silica glass itself (rather than its atomic arrangement) is being compared to alumina glass’s atomic arrangement. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modier.

The comma after “themselves” is used conventionally to separate the rst item (“they can clone themselves”) and the second item (“enter a dormant state in times of drought”) in the series of things mosses can do. Choice A is incorrect because a semicolon can’t be used in this way to separate items in a simple series such as this.

    optionB: "B. indiscriminate,",
    optionC: "C. indiscriminate",
    optionD: "D. indiscriminate:",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between two main clauses.

Choice A is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it’s conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction. Furthermore, the conjunction "and" fails to indicate that what follows is an explanation of goats’ nondiscriminatory behavior when it comes to their diets. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can’t be used in this way to join two main clauses ("goats…indiscriminate" and "they…weeds").

      "Choice A is the best answer. Nothing belongs to the “poems” in the sentence, so it should not be possessive—just a simple plural noun. The protagonist does belong to the novel—it’s the protagonist of the novel—so “novel” needs to be a singular possessive noun. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This choice uses the singular possessive “poem’s,” but the text indicates that it should be the simple plural “poems”: there is more than one poem, and nothing belongs to the poems. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn’t complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This choice uses the singular possessive “poem’s,” but the text indicates that it should be the simple plural “poems”: there is more than one poem, and nothing belongs to the poems.

    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. It appropriately uses a period to mark the end of one independent clause ("In 2000…settings") and the start of another ("She founded… professionals"). Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence error. Both the clause before the blank ("In 2000…settings") and the clause after the blank ("she… professionals") are independent clauses, so they need to be separated by punctuation. Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a comma splice error. It incorrectly joins two independent clauses with just a comma.

This choice results in a run-on sentence, an error caused when two independent clauses are joined without punctuation or appropriate conjunctions.

      "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is end-of-sentence punctuation. This choice correctly uses a question mark to punctuate the interrogative clause “could the blueberries thrive,” which asks a direct question at the end of the sentence. Choice A is incorrect because a period can’t be used in this way to punctuate an interrogative clause, such as “could the blueberries thrive,” at the end of a sentence. Choice B is incorrect because the context requires an interrogative clause. The declarative clause “the blueberries could thrive” incorrectly indicates that it was known that the blueberries could thrive in alkaline soil, whereas Michel had yet to nd this out. Choice C is incorrect because a question mark can’t be used in this way to punctuate a declarative clause, such as “the blueberries could thrive,” at the end of a sentence.",

    optionB: "B. was already serving",
    optionC: "C. already serves",
    optionD: "D. had already served",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. Misaka served in World War II before he joined the New York Knicks in 1947. To show that a past occurrence took place before another past occurrence, we need to use “had” + the past tense form of the verb. This is called the past perfect tense. Choice A is incorrect. Misaka served in World War II before he joined the Knicks. Both events are in the past, but his service in World War II happened earlier, so we need a verb that makes it clear that his service (and the two national championships) had ended by the time he joined the Knicks. Choice B is incorrect. “Was already serving” forms the continuous past tense, which we use when we’re showing a past action that was ongoing. Misaka served in World War II before he joined the Knicks. Both events are in the past, but they’re not happening at the same time, so we shouldn’t use the continuous past tense here. Choice C is incorrect. Misaka served in World War II in the past, so we shouldn’t use the present tense “serves.”",

In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence ("The city…system") and another ("Analyzing…footage"). The participial phrase beginning with "analyzing" modies the subject of the second sentence, "the AI algorithm." Choice A is incorrect. Placing a dash before "analyzing" creates a confusing and ambiguous modifying element ("analyzing...areas") and a comma splice between "areas" and "the AI algorithm."

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. "Ascended" is in the simple past tense. Since Kamehameha became king in the past, this makes the most sense. Choice B is incorrect. "Will ascend" is in the future tense, but we wouldn’t know about Kamehameha III’s ascent if it hadn’t happened yet. The information in the sentence, as well as the tense of other verbs, tells us that the events described happened in the past. Choice C is incorrect. "Ascends" is in the simple present tense. However, the information in the sentence, as well as the tense of other verbs, tells us that the events described happened in the past. Choice D is incorrect. "Is ascending" is in the continuous present tense, which we use to show that something is ongoing, but this doesn’t make sense here—the information in the sentence, as well as the tense of other verbs, tells us that the events described happened in the past.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. The semicolon is correctly used to join the rst main clause (“To humans…prey”) and the second main clause (“rather…approach”). Further, the comma after the adverb “rather” is correctly used to separate the adverb from the main clause (“the brightly…approach”) it modies, logically indicating that the information in this clause (how the spider’s behavior appears to humans) is contrary to the information in the previous clause (how the spider’s behavior does not appear to humans). Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can’t be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without appropriate punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice C is incorrect.

No punctuation is needed to set off the proper noun “Stina Chyn” from the title that describes Chyn, “critic.” Because “Stina Chyn” is essential information identifying the “critic,” no punctuation is necessary. Further, no punctuation is needed between the verb “claims” and the following quotation because the quotation is integrated into the structure of the sentence.

This choice creates a tense issue. “Has leveraged” is the present perfect tense, which is used for an action that began in the past and continues into the present. Lincoln started leveraging his rivals’ talents in 1860—it’s denitely not still happening today. So the present perfect tense isn’t appropriate. Choice B is incorrect.

      "Choice C is the best answer. A comma is the appropriate way to link the dependent clause “While...not” and the independent clause that follows. Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. “While...not” is a dependent clause, which must be separated from the independent clause that follows with some sort of punctuation. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. “While one requires oxygen and one does not” isn’t an independent clause, so it can’t stand alone as a complete sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. “While one requires oxygen and one does not” isn’t an independent clause, so it can’t be linked to the clause that follows with a semicolon.",

    optionD: "D. CE; making",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. The phrase “making…at the time” provides additional information about Cahokia that’s not required for the sentence to make sense or function grammatically. As a nonessential supplement, this phrase should be separated from the rest of the sentence with a comma. Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence. The nonessential descriptive aside “making…at the time” needs to be separated from the rest of the sentence with a comma. Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence fragment. “Making…at the time” doesn’t have a subject and can’t stand on its own as a sentence. Thus, it can’t be separated from the rest of the sentence with a period. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. “Making…at the time” doesn’t have a subject and can’t stand on its own as an independent clause.

      "Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census—a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been\ndescribed at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s census.",
    optionB:
      "B. some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct\nspecies by Coll and colleagues.",
    optionC:
      "C. Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganism than Coll and\ncolleagues were.",
    optionD:
      "D. the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number\nof microorganism species.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did. Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to withinspecies variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.",

    question:
      "A common assumption among art historians is that the invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century displaced the painted portrait in the public consciousness. The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the rise of photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography’s impact on the portrait miniature may be overstated. Although records from art exhibitions in the Netherlands from 1820 to 1892 show a decrease in the number of both full-sized and miniature portraits submitted, this trend was established before the invention of photography. Based on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth century?",
    optionA:
      "A. Factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature’s decline.",

      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, conceptual artists Gins and Arakawa have designed an apartment building that is disorienting because of several unconventional elements, such as uneven kitchen counters and “a door to nowhere.” The text goes on to suggest that there may be benets to this kind of design because lmmaker Yamaoka lived in the apartment building for four years and reported health benets. Thus, although the design is impractical, it may improve the well-being of the apartment building’s residents. Choice A is incorrect.

When the results of molecular analysis of two species of octopus —an animal known for its intelligence—were announced in 2022, the conrmation of a LINE transposon in Octopus vulgaris and Octopus bimaculoides genomes prompted researchers to hypothesize that that transposon family is tied to a species’ capacity for advanced cognition.

      'Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes why the nding about the microorganism community composition was important. The text describes an experiment by Eva Kaštovská and her team in which they collected plant-soil cores at one elevation and transplanted them to sites at a lower elevation, where the mean air temperature was warmer. Kaštovská and her team observed that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores and that "crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged," which allowed the team to attribute the acceleration to changes in microorganism activity brought about by the difference in temperature. This strongly implies that the team wouldn’t have been able to make that attribution otherwise, meaning that a change in microorganism composition represented another possible explanation for the acceleration that had to be ruled out. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text says microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients increased in the transplanted cores, this is unrelated to what’s important about the nding that the microorganism composition didn’t change—that it allowed the team to attribute the change in activity solely to the change in temperature.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Barve’s investigation shows that some species of Himalayan songbirds have evolved feathers that better regulate body temperature than do the feathers of\nother species, contradicting previous predictions.",
    optionB:
      "B. Barve found an association between habitat temperature and feather structure among Himalayan songbirds, lending new support to a general prediction.",
    optionC:
      "C. Barve discovered that songbirds have adapted to their environment by growing feathers without at and smooth sections, complicating an earlier hypothesis.",
    optionD:
      "D. The results of Barve’s study suggest that the ability of birds to withstand cold temperatures is determined more strongly by feather length than feather structure,\nchallenging an established belief.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. The text describes how Barve found an association between habitat temperature and feather structure among Himalayan songbirds, which supports the general prediction that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature. Choice A is incorrect. Barve’s study isn’t said to contradict previous predictions. In fact, the study supports the prediction described in the rst sentence, which is that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature. Choice C is incorrect. Barve’s study isn’t said to “complicate an earlier hypothesis.” In fact, the study supports the earlier prediction described in the rst sentence, which is that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t compare the importance of feather length and feather structure, and it doesn’t say that Barve’s study challenges any established beliefs. In fact, the study supports the prediction described in the rst sentence, which is that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature.",

    optionD:
      "D. was substantially lower than uncertainty about trade policy in 2005 and substantially higher than uncertainty about trade policy in 2010.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively illustrate the text’s claim about general economic policy uncertainty in the United Kingdom. The graph presents values for economic policy uncertainty in tax and public spending policy, trade policy, and general economic policy in the UK from 2005 to 2010. The graph shows that in 2005, the value for general economic policy uncertainty (approximately 90) was substantially lower than the value for uncertainty about trade policy specically (approximately 160). It also shows that in 2010, the value for general economic policy uncertainty (approximately 120) was substantially higher than the value for uncertainty about trade policy (approximately 70). The substantial differences between these values in 2005 and 2010 support the claim that a general measure may not fully reect uncertainty about specic areas of policy. Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that the level of general economic policy uncertainty was similar to the level of uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in both 2005 (with values of approximately 90 and 100, respectively) and 2009 (with values of approximately 80 and 75, respectively). Choice B is incorrect because the graph shows that general economic policy uncertainty was higher than uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in 2006, 2007, and 2009, not that it was lower each year from 2005 to 2010. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that general economic policy uncertainty reached its highest level in 2010, which was when uncertainty about tax and public spending policy also reached its highest level, not its lowest level.",

      "Fish whose DNA has been modied to include genetic material from other species are known as transgenic. Some transgenic sh have genes from jellysh that result in uorescence (that is, they glow in the dark). Although these sh were initially engineered for research purposes in the 1990s, they were sold as pets in the 2000s and can now be found in the wild in creeks in Brazil. A student in a biology seminar who is writing a paper on these sh asserts that their escape from Brazilian sh farms into the wild may have signicant negative long-term ecological effects. Which quotation from a researcher would best support the student’s assertion?",
    optionA:
      "A. “In one site in the wild where transgenic sh were observed, females outnumbered males, while in another the numbers of females and males were equivalent.”",

    optionD:
      "D. “Through interbreeding, transgenic sh might introduce the trait of uorescence into wild sh populations, making those populations more vulnerable to\npredators.”",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because this quotation would best support the student’s assertion that the escape of transgenic sh from Brazilian sh farms into the wild may have signicant negative long-term ecological effects. The text explains that transgenic sh have DNA that includes genetic material from other species, that some transgenic sh have genes from jellysh that make them glow in the dark, and that glow-in-the-dark transgenic sh can now be found in the wild in Brazilian creeks. The quotation indicates why the escape of these sh may have negative long-term ecological effects: glow-in-the-dark transgenic sh might introduce uorescence into wild sh populations by breeding with wild sh, causing wild sh to glow in the dark and thereby allowing predators to prey on them much more easily. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t mention any negative effects of the introduction of uorescent transgenic sh into the wild. The quotation merely compares the ratio of females to males at two sites in the wild where transgenic sh have been observed. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t support the idea that the escape of uorescent transgenic sh from Brazilian sh farms may have signicant negative long-term ecological effects. Rather, the quotation suggests that more research is needed to understand the effects. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation supports the idea that transgenic sh may be present in more ecosystems than has been observed; it doesn’t address whether the presence of uorescent transgenic sh affects these ecosystems.",

    optionD:
      "D. at least 4 lizard species use, on average, less than 100% of their maximal speed while pursuing prey.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that complete the text’s discussion of lizard species’ use of maximal speed when escaping predators. According to the text, moving at maximal speed (the highest speed possible) requires so much energy that it is not always an effective strategy for animals, even when they are escaping predators. The graph displays data on the average percent of maximal speed used by lizard species while either escaping predators or pursuing prey. The graph categorizes the data for both pursuing and escaping by the number of species using 30%–39% of maximal speed, 40%–49% of maximal speed, 50%–59% of maximal speed, 60%–69% of maximal speed, 70%–79% of maximal speed, 80%–89% of maximal speed, and 90%–100% of maximal speed, respectively. In the graph, there is at least one species in each of the following percent categories for maximal speed while escaping predators: 50%–59%, 60%–69%, 70%–79%, and 80%–89%. Thus, the data in the graph show that multiple lizard species move at an average of less than 90% of their maximal speed while escaping predation. Choice A is incorrect because the data in the graph isn’t organized in such a way that a comparison of the percentage of maximal speed used when escaping predation with the percentage used when pursuing prey is possible at the level of individual species. Choice C is incorrect. It is true that in the graph, the percent category with the largest number of species using maximal speed while escaping predators is 90%–100% (8 species total). However, these data don’t complete the text, which is concerned instead with how animals are discouraged from using maximal speed even when escaping predators because of the amount of energy required to use it. Choice D is incorrect because these data from the graph pertain to maximal speed while pursuing prey and therefore don’t complete the text’s discussion of lizard species’ use of maximal speed when escaping predators.",

      "D. Grass cover increased from 1987 to 1993 and from 1993 to 2006, whereas forest cover decreased in those periods.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the Jordanelle Dam led to changes that beneted grass plants but not trees. The graph shows characteristics of the banks of the Provo River downstream of the Jordanelle Dam in three different years—1987, 1993, and 2006. Specically, the graph shows the amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the dam was benecial for grass plants but not for trees—grass cover increased signicantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined. Choice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year. Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the dam led to changes that beneted grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the dam might indicate that the dam beneted grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years doesn’t indicate that the dam failed to benet trees.",

However, a massive study in forest management and preservation spanning 700,000 hectares in Oregon’s Malheur National Forest calls that view into question. So far, results of the study suggest that forest plots that have undergone limited logging (the careful removal of a controlled number of trees) may be more robust than plots that haven’t been logged at all. These results, in turn, suggest that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. logging may be useful for maintaining healthy forests, provided it is limite",

      "B. other forest management strategies are more effective than limited logging.",
    optionC:
      "C. as time passes, it will be dicult to know whether limited logging has any benets.",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the potential effects of logging on forest conservation. The text begins by stating that logging practices are often thought of as being contrary to forest conservation efforts. Then, the text presents the results of a research study examining the effect of limited logging practices on specic forest plots, nding that the plots with limited logging may be "more robust" (healthier) than the plots that hadn’t been logged at all. Given these results, it follows that logging may be a useful practice for maintaining healthy forests if it is practiced in a limited way. Choice B is incorrect because the study referenced in the text only provides information on limited logging as a potential forest management strategy. There is no information in the text about how other forest management strategies support forest conservation efforts. Therefore, the text does not support the assertion that other forest management strategies are more successful than limited logging. Choice C is incorrect because the text presents a research study with ndings that specic plots of forest with limited logging may be more robust than the forest plots that were not logged. Rather than suggesting that it is hard to know whether limited logging might be benecial, the text suggests that the practice could be useful in forest conservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the results of a research study that compares the health of forest plots with limited logging to forest plots that were not logged. It does not take a position on the best way to support forest health but rather presents a research study with ndings that question conventionally held thoughts regarding the practice of logging.',

      "When fashion designer Lloyd Henri Kiva New opened his store in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 1945, he quickly became known for creating delicately crafted leather goods, like belts and hats. He was perhaps most renowned for his colorful handbags, which he made by hand using a long and painstaking process. As he gained more customers, New began using sewing machines and other tools to help him produce bags more eciently, though he continued to handcraft the crucial details that made each bag unique. Based on the text, what would have been the most likely consequence if New had not begun using sewing machines?",
    optionA:
      "A. He would have been unable to ensure that each bag included unique, handcrafted details.",
    optionB:
      "B. He would have struggled to meet the increasing demand for his bags.",
    optionC: "C. He would have had to individually design each bag he produce",
    optionD:
      "D. He would not have been able to generate as much interest in his bags.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the most likely consequence if New had not begun using sewing machines. The text states that New gained new customers and that sewing machines allowed him to make bags more eciently, or in less time than he could when sewing by hand. It’s reasonable to conclude that if New hadn’t reduced the time it took to make each bag by starting to use sewing machines, it would have been hard for him to keep up with the increased demand. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that New added unique, handcrafted details to his bags before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that individually designing each bag would have been a consequence of not using sewing machines, since New was already designing unique details for each bag before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that people were already interested in New’s bags before he started using sewing machines. Rather than allowing New to generate more interest in his bags, sewing machines helped New keep up with the interest that had already grown.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would most directly support the arts journalist’s claim about Enwezor’s work as a curator and art historian. In the text, the arts journalist asserts that Enwezor wished not just to focus on modern African artists but also to show “how their work ts into the larger context of global modern art and art history,” or how their work relates to artistic developments and work by other artists elsewhere in the world. The description of Postwar: Art Between the Pacic and the Atlantic, 1945–1965 indicates that Enwezor and Siegel’s exhibition brought works by African artists together with works by artists from other countries, thus supporting the arts journalist’s claim that Enwezor sought to show works by African artists in a context of global modern art and art history. Choice A is incorrect because it describes a retrospective that wouldn’t support the arts journalist’s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists t into the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of El Anatsui: Triumphant Scale indicates that the retrospective focused only on the work of a single African artist, El Anatsui. The description doesn’t suggest that the exhibition showed how El Anatsui’s works t into a global artistic context. Choice C is incorrect because it describes an exhibition that wouldn’t support the arts journalist’s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists relate to the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of The Short Century: Independence and Liberation Movements in Africa, 1945–1994 indicates that the exhibition showed how African artists were inuenced by movements for independence from European colonial powers following the Second World War. Although this suggests that Enwezor intended the exhibition to place works by African artists in a political context, it doesn’t indicate that the works were placed in a global artistic context. Choice D is incorrect because it describes an exhibition that wouldn’t support the arts journalist’s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists relate to the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of In/sight: African Photographers, 1940 to the Present indicates that the exhibition was intended to reveal the broad range of approaches taken by African photographers, not that the exhibition showed how photography by African artists ts into a global artistic context.",

      "Male túngara frogs make complex calls to attract mates, but their calls also attract frog-biting midges, insects that feed on the frogs’ blood. Researchers Ximena Bernal and Priyanka de Silva wondered if the calls alone are sucient for midges to locate the frogs or if midges use carbon dioxide emitted by frogs as an additional cue to their prey’s whereabouts, like mosquitoes do. In an experiment, the researchers placed two midge traps in a túngara frog breeding area. One trap played recordings of túngara frog calls and the other released carbon dioxide along with playing the calls. Bernal and de Silva concluded that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges. Which nding from the experiment, if true, would most directly support Bernal and de Silva’s conclusion?",
    optionA:
      "A. Only a small number of midges were found in the traps, though the majority were found in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide.",

    optionD:
      "D. The trap that released carbon dioxide and played calls attracted few midges when carbon dioxide concentrations were low but attracted many midges when\ncarbon dioxide concentrations were high.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ conclusion that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges regarding the location of male túngara frogs. The text begins by stating that the mating call of the male túngara frogs also attracts frog-biting midges, which prey on the frogs’ blood. Researchers Bernal and de Silva were curious if the mating calls were sucient signals for the midges to locate the frogs or if midges also used carbon dioxide emitted by the frogs to locate their prey. The text then details the procedure the researchers used to investigate their question and summarizes their conclusion—that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the midges. Thus, if more midges were found in the researchers’ trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide, it follows that the frog calls seem sucient without the carbon dioxide cue. This nding supports the researchers’ conclusion that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges. Choice A is incorrect because nding that the majority of frog-biting midges were found in the traps that both played the mating call and released carbon dioxide would present evidence that directly refutes the researchers’ conclusion—that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the frog-biting midges regarding the location of túngara frogs. Choice B is incorrect because if the midges entered the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide only during or immediately after carbon dioxide was released, that would suggest that the midges used the carbon dioxide as a way to locate their prey, a nding that would contradict the researchers’ conclusion that carbon dioxide was not an additional cue to the midges. Choice D is incorrect because a trap attracting larger numbers of midges with high carbon dioxide concentrations than a trap with low carbon dioxide concentrations suggests that carbon dioxide might serve as an additional cue to the midges as to the location on the frogs, a nding contrary to the researchers’ conclusion.",

      "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that Lowell describes an element of nature as an active participant in the experience of a nighttime scene on a body of water. The quotation presents the image of the moon shining on a body of water. However, instead of describing the moon in passive terms or simply stating that it reects through the water and onto the sandy shore, the quotation portrays the moon as being engaged in the humanlike action of writing a legend. In other words, the moon is participating actively in the nighttime scene. Choice B is incorrect. Although the quotation describes a nighttime scene on a body of water, the element of nature in these lines—the waves—isn’t portrayed as an active participant in an experience; instead, the waves merely ripple softly against a canoe, as waves would normally do. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t present a nighttime scene on a body of water; instead, it describes petals falling from a rose. Choice D is incorrect. Although the quotation presents an image of an element of nature—the moon—it doesn’t mention a body of water; moreover, it portrays the moon not as an active participant in a scene but instead as static or unchanging (“ever and always the same”).",

      "Choice D is the best answer. The text says that the formation at Mistaken Point contains fossils of “the earliest multicellular organisms,” which implies that these fossils are from an older time period than the fossils of “prehistoric human ancestors” found in the Minatogawa quarry.

    question:
      "The following text is adapted from Johanna Spyri’s 1881 novel Heidi (translated by Elisabeth Stork in 1915). Eight-year-old Heidi and her friend’s grandmother are looking at some illustrated books. Heidi had come and was looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures in the large books, that Grandmama was showing her. Suddenly she screamed aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful ock grazing on a green pasture. In the middle a shepherd was standing, leaning on his crook. The setting sun was shedding a golden light over everything. With glowing eyes Heidi devoured the scene. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Heidi is upset until she sees a serene image of a pasture in one of Grandmama’s books.",
    optionB:
      "B. Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama’s books.",
    optionC:
      "C. Heidi is initially frightened by an image in one of Grandmama’s books but quickly comes to appreciate its beauty.",
    optionD:
      "D. Heidi is inspecting an image in one of Grandmama’s books because she has never seen a shepherd with his sheep before.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama’s books. In the text, Heidi screams upon rst seeing the picture of the green pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here the reaction is followed by descriptions of an image that’s peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to describe Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,” suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Together, these descriptions suggest that Heidi is thrilled and intrigued by the image in the book. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Heidi is upset before seeing the peaceful image of the green pasture. Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as “looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures” in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she’s unhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon rst seeing the image, the text’s description of the image and Heidi’s other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear. The text describes the images in the book as “splendid” and the particular image that causes her to scream as peaceful rather than frightening. It also describes Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,” suggesting that the image of the green pasture delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Choice D is incorrect because it’s unclear from the text whether Heidi has ever seen a shepherd with his sheep before. The text merely suggests that she is delighted and fascinated by the image of the shepherd and his sheep.",

      "Ochre sea stars live in tidal pools along the shoreline of the Pacic Ocean. At night, they move to higher shore levels in search of prey. But scientists Corey Garza and Carlos Robles noticed that ochre sea stars stayed at lower levels at night after heavy rains. Garza and Robles hypothesized that a layer of fresh water formed by rainfall was a barrier to the sea stars. To test their hypothesis, the scientists did an experiment. They placed some sea stars in a climbable tank of seawater and other sea stars in a similar tank of seawater with a layer of fresh water on top. Then, the scientists watched the sea stars’ behavior at night. Which nding from the experiment, if true, would most directly support Garza and Robles’s hypothesis?",
    optionA:
      "A. None of the sea stars climbed to the tops of the tanks, but sea stars in the tank with only seawater moved around the bottom of the tank more than sea stars in\nthe other tank di",
    optionB:
      "B. Sea stars in the tank with only seawater climbed to the top of the tank, but sea stars in the other tank stopped climbing just below the layer of fresh water.",
    optionC:
      "C. Both groups of sea stars climbed to the tops of the tanks, but sea stars in the tank with only seawater climbed more slowly than sea stars in the other tank di",
    optionD:
      "D. Sea stars in the tank with only seawater mostly stayed near the bottom of the tank, but sea stars in the other tank climbed into the layer of fresh water.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support Garza and Robles’s hypothesis that a layer of fresh water forms a barrier to ochre sea stars. The text explains that the sea stars tend to move to higher shore levels at night in search of prey, but after a heavy rain, the sea stars stay at lower shore levels. Garza and Robles hypothesize that rainfall results in a layer of fresh water that the sea stars don’t cross. To determine whether fresh water forms a barrier to sea stars, Garza and Robles observed how sea stars behaved in a tank of only seawater and in a tank of seawater with a layer of fresh water on top. If the sea stars climbed to the top of the tank with only seawater but stopped climbing just below the layer of fresh water in the other tank, that would suggest that fresh water does indeed serve as a barrier to the sea stars, thereby supporting Garza and Robles’s hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect because nding that sea stars in the tank with only seawater moved around the bottom of the tank more than sea stars in the other tank did but that none of the stars in either tank climbed to the top would be irrelevant to Garza and Robles’s hypothesis. Such a nding would reveal nothing about whether fresh water serves as a barrier to sea stars. Choice C is incorrect because nding that sea stars climbed to the top of both tanks would weaken, not support, Garza and Robles’s hypothesis, since it would indicate that the layer of fresh water wasn’t a barrier to the sea stars. Choice D is incorrect because nding that sea stars in the tank with only seawater mostly stayed near the bottom of the tank but sea stars in the other tank climbed into the layer of fresh water wouldn’t support Garza and Robles’s hypothesis. Instead, such a nding would suggest that the layer of fresh water wasn’t a barrier to the sea stars, thereby weakening Garza and Robles’s hypothesis.",

      "C. most of the farmers who mainly cultivated non–root vegetables in north and south Ondo were women.",
    optionD:
      "D. a relatively equal proportion of women across the three regions of Ondo mainly cultivated cereals.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively complete the example of Eludoyin and his colleagues’ ndings concerning female farmers in some regions of Ondo State, Nigeria. The graph presents values for the percentage of Ondo State small-scale farmers who are female, by type of crop and region. The graph shows that of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables, approximately 57% in north Ondo and approximately 54% in south Ondo are female; in other words, most of those farmers are female, which exemplies the idea that female farmers make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating specic types of crops in some regions. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that in south Ondo, most of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables are women (approximately 54%), but that only about 35% (less than half) of the farmers mainly cultivating cereals are women. Choice B is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that more women in central Ondo mainly cultivate cereals than mainly cultivate root crops (approximately 36% and 20%, respectively). Additionally, it doesn’t effectively complete the example because the graph shows that female farmers don’t make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers for any type of crop in central Ondo. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t effectively complete the example; it simply states that a relatively equal proportion of women across the three regions mainly cultivate cereals, which doesn’t address the value for that proportion and thus doesn’t show that a majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating certain crops are female.",

Botanist Niccoletta Cannone wondered how the warming of Antarctica’s climate in recent years had affected these species, so she visited a site in Antarctica, rst in 2009 and later in 2018, to count the number of plants growing there. Cannone found that the area of land covered by the two species had signicantly expanded during the nine-year period. While both species likely beneted from warming temperatures, Colobanthus quitensis ______ Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the comparison?",

    optionD:
      "D. covered land newly freed from ice at a rate 55% faster than that of Deschampsia antarctic",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the comparison of how Colobanthus quitensis beneted from warming temperatures with how Deschampsia antarctica beneted from them. The table shows the land area covered by these two plant species at a site in Antarctica. According to the table, Colobanthus quitensis increased the area it covered by 55% from 2009 to 2018, whereas Deschampsia antarctica increased the area it covered by 28% during the same period. It therefore follows that Colobanthus quitensis saw a greater expansion than Deschampsia antarctica did and that Colobanthus quitensis increased the area of land it covered by more than half. Choice A is incorrect because according to the table, Deschampsia antarctica covered 1,230 square meters of land in 2009 and 1,576 square meters of land in 2018. Deschampsia antarctica therefore covered a larger, not a smaller, area of land in 2018 than in 2009. Moreover, there’s no information in the text or the table that suggests that one species of the plant suppressed the other. Choice C is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the data in the table. The table shows the land area covered by Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica and the percent increase in area covered by the two species from 2009 to 2018, not the average size of individual plants belonging to the two species. The data in the table therefore can’t be used to make a comparison of the increase in individual plants’ average size. Choice D is incorrect because the table shows the land area covered by Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica and the percent increase in area covered by the two species from 2009 to 2018, not the rate at which the species increased the area they covered. Moreover, there’s nothing in the table or the text that suggests that the areas covered by the two species were newly freed from ice.",

      "Many literary theorists distinguish between fabula, a narrative’s content, and syuzhet, a narrative’s arrangement and presentation of events. In the lm The Godfather Part II, the fabula is the story of the Corleone family, and the syuzhet is the presentation of the story as it alternates between two timelines in 1901 and 1958. But literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin maintained that fabula and syuzhet are insucient to completely describe a narrative—he held that systematic categorizations of artistic phenomena discount the subtle way in which meaning is created by interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience.

    optionD:
      "D. Narratives that are told out of chronological order are more dicult for audiences to understand than are narratives presented chronologically.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by explaining that many literary theorists rely on the concepts of fabula (a narrative’s content) and syuzhet (a narrative’s arrangement and presentation of events) and illustrates these concepts by explaining how they can be applied to the lm The Godfather Part II. The text then discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a literary theorist, argued that fabula and syuzhet can’t fully describe a narrative, since systematic categorizations such as these fail to account for all the ways in which interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience produce meaning. Thus, the main idea is that Bakhtin argued that there are important characteristics of narratives that are not fully encompassed by two concepts that other theorists have used to analyze narratives. Choice B is incorrect because according to the text, Mikhail Bakhtin believed that meaning was created through the interactions of the artist, narrative, and audience, not simply through the interaction between the audience and narrative; moreover, the text doesn’t address whether Bakhtin focused on the ways in which different people interpret narratives differently. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text implies that the storytelling methods used in The Godfather Part II are complicated, it discusses the lm only to illustrate how the concepts of fabula and syuzhet may be applied to a narrative. The lm’s storytelling methods aren’t the primary focus of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses The Godfather Part II, whose narrative doesn’t adhere to a single chronological order, only to illustrate the concepts of fabula (a narrative’s content) and syuzhet (a narrative’s arrangement and presentation of events). The primary focus of this text isn’t the structure of this lm or of other narratives that are told out of chronological order; moreover, the text doesn’t consider whether such structures make it harder for audiences to understand narratives.",

She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.

For instance, Romeo and Juliet, which is set in the Italy of Shakespeare’s time, tackles the themes of parents versus children and love versus hate, and the play continues to be read and produced widely around the world. But understanding Shakespeare’s so-called history plays can require a knowledge of several centuries of English history. Consequently, ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",

    optionD:
      "D. experts in English history tend to prefer Shakespeare’s history plays to his other works.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the relative appeal of different kinds of plays by Shakespeare to today’s audiences. According to the text, Shakespeare’s tragedies address broad themes that continue to appeal to today’s audiences. Indeed, the text suggests that these themes are timeless, as illustrated by the example of Romeo and Juliet, which the text states is still read and widely performed despite being set in the Italy of Shakespeare’s time. In contrast, the text indicates that audiences and readers may need to be familiar with several centuries of English history in order to understand Shakespeare’s history plays. Because many theatergoers and readers are unlikely to possess such extensive historical knowledge, it follows that they are likely to nd Shakespeare’s history plays less engaging than his more accessible tragedies. Choice B is incorrect because the text never introduces a comparison between Shakespeare’s tragedies and twentieth-century plays, only between Shakespeare’s tragedies and his history plays. Since twentieth-century plays aren’t mentioned, there’s no basis in the text for the idea that some of Shakespeare’s tragedies are more relevant than twentieth-century plays to today’s audiences. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Romeo and Juliet is thematically accessible to today’s audiences, it doesn’t suggest that Romeo and Juliet is more accessible than Shakespeare’s other tragedies. Rather, the text presents Romeo and Juliet as an example to support the idea that Shakespeare’s tragedies hold continued appeal for today’s readers and theatergoers. Choice D is incorrect. Although experts in English history would likely possess the knowledge needed to understand Shakespeare’s history plays, the text never mentions such experts or suggests that they would enjoy the history plays more than Shakespeare’s other works.",

Before the 2006 study, estimates of the average velocity were low enough for the LMC to maintain an orbit around the Milky Way galaxy, but according to an analysis by Gurtina Besla and colleagues, the estimated velocity from the 2006 study is too high for the LMC to maintain such an orbit. Therefore, if Besla and colleagues are correct, the maximum average velocity for the LMC that would allow it to maintain orbit around the Milky Way is likely ______ Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?",
    optionA: "A. above 344 km/s but below 378 km/s.",
    optionB: "B. above 297 km/s but below 344 km/s.",
    optionC: "C. above 378 km/s.",
    optionD: "D. below 297 km/s.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the table to give the range of velocities for the LMC from the 1980 value (344 km/s) to the 2006 value (378 km/s), thereby effectively completing the text. The text indicates that before 2006, all the estimated velocities of the LMC were within the range necessary to maintain orbit around the Milky Way galaxy. It then indicates that, according to Besla and colleagues, the 2006 estimate of 378 km/s is too high to maintain that orbit. This strongly implies that if the 1980 value (344 km/s) is below the orbital threshold, and if Besla and colleagues are correct that the 2006 value (378 km/s) is above that threshold, the maximum orbital velocity for the LMC must be somewhere in the range from above 344 km/s to below 378 km/s. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the rst estimate that exceeded the velocity needed to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Thus, the 1980 estimate of 344 km/s and the 1994 estimate of 297 km/s must both be below the maximum possible orbital velocity for the LMC. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that Besla and colleagues’ analysis found that the velocity from the 2006 study (378 km/s) was too high for the LMC to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Therefore, if a velocity of 378 km/s is too high, an even higher velocity will also be too high. Choice D is incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the rst to exceed the velocity range required to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Thus, the 1994 estimate of 297 km/s must be below the maximum possible orbital velocity for the LMC.",

    question:
      "Mosasaurs were large marine reptiles that lived in the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 100 million to 66 million years ago. Celina Suarez, Alberto PérezHuerta, and T. Lynn Harrell Jr. examined oxygen-18 isotopes in mosasaur tooth enamel in order to calculate likely mosasaur body temperatures and determined that mosasaurs were endothermic—that is, they used internal metabolic processes to maintain a stable body temperature in a variety of ambient temperatures. Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell claim that endothermy would have enabled mosasaurs to include relatively cold polar waters in their range. Which nding, if true, would most directly support Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell’s claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. Mosasaurs’ likely body temperatures are easier to determine from tooth enamel oxygen-18 isotope data than the body temperatures of nonendothermic Late\nCretaceous marine reptiles are.",
    optionB:
      "B. Fossils of both mosasaurs and nonendothermic marine reptiles have been found in roughly equal numbers in regions known to be near the poles during the\nLate Cretaceous, though in lower concentrations than elsewhere.",
    optionC:
      "C. Several mosasaur fossils have been found in regions known to be near the poles during the Late Cretaceous, while relatively few fossils of nonendothermic\nmarine reptiles have been found in those locations.",
    optionD:
      "D. During the Late Cretaceous, seawater temperatures were likely higher throughout mosasaurs’ range, including near the poles, than seawater temperatures at\nthose same latitudes are today.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the nding that, if true, would best support Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell’s claim about mosasaurs. The text states that Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell’s research on mosasaur tooth enamel led them to conclude that mosasaurs were endothermic, which means that they could live in waters at many different temperatures and still maintain a stable body temperature. The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers’ claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range. Choice A is incorrect because nding that it’s easier to determine mosasaur body temperatures from tooth enamel data than it is to determine nonendothermic reptile body temperatures wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim. Whether one research process is more dicult than another indicates nothing about the results of those processes and therefore is irrelevant to the issue of where mosasaurs lived and what enabled them to live in those locations. Choice B is incorrect because nding roughly equal numbers of mosasaur and nonendothermic marine reptile fossils in areas that were near the poles in the Late Cretaceous would suggest that endothermy didn’t give mosasaurs any particular advantage when it came to expanding their range to include relatively cold polar waters, thereby weakening the researchers’ claim rather than supporting it. Choice D is incorrect because nding that the temperature of seawater in the Late Cretaceous was warmer than seawater today wouldn’t weaken the researchers’ claim. Seawater in the Late Cretaceous could have been warmer than seawater today but still cold enough for endothermy to be advantageous to mosasaurs, so this nding wouldn’t provide enough information to either support or weaken the researchers’ claim.",

    question:
      "A contraction of “you all,” the pronoun “y’all” has long been used as a plural version of “you” in the South and in Black communities around the US. In recent decades, most other English-speaking communities in the US have begun to use “y’all.” What explains its rise in popularity? Many varieties of English have no pronoun that specically addresses more than one person and instead must use “you” to address both one person and more than one. But “y’all” always refers to two or more people. As a result, it conveys the speaker’s meaning more precisely than “you” can. Which question does the text most directly attempt to answer?",
    optionA:
      "A. How many other plural versions of the pronoun “you” are there in English, besides “y’all”?",
    optionB:
      "B. Why has the pronoun “y’all” become more widely used in the US?",

      "C. When was the rst recorded use of the pronoun “y’all” in the English language?",
    optionD:
      "D. Is “y’all” commonly used in English-speaking regions of the world besides the US?",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a question that the text is attempting to answer: why has the pronoun "y’all" become more widely used in the US? The text begins by explaining where and how the plural pronoun "y’all" originated and then goes on to state that its use has been rising in popularity, even in areas outside of its place of origin. The text then attributes this rise in popularity to the fact that many varieties of English do not have a pronoun to address more than one person, and thus "you" must function as both a singular and plural pronoun. Choice A is incorrect because while the text states that "y’all" is used as a plural of "you" in English, it does not discuss other plural forms of the word. Choice C is incorrect because while the text discusses the general origins of the pronoun "y’all," it does not state when the use of the pronoun was rst recorded in the English language. Choice D is incorrect because though the text addresses the use of the pronoun "y’all" within English-speaking communities in the US, it does not address its use outside of that geographic area.',

    optionD:
      "D. “One series of Catlett’s prints, made by the artist using the linoleum cut method, depicts several notable African American women, including Harriet Tubman and\nSojourner Truth.”",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a quotation about Elizabeth Catlett that supports the student’s claim that this artist had a talent for unifying various traditions and styles in her work. The quotation explains that to create the work, Catlett combined Indigenous sculpture with the visual aesthetic of modern muralists from Mexico as well as that of German artist Kathe Kollwitz. In other words, Catlett was able to unify several artistic traditions and styles within a single sculpture. Choice B is incorrect because in discussing the technique and subject matter of Catlett’s collage, the quotation makes no reference to particular traditions or styles. Choice C is incorrect because in describing the sculpture, the quotation doesn’t mention any artistic traditions or styles that Catlett may have synthesized to create the work. Choice D is incorrect because in discussing Catlett’s prints of notable African American women, the quotation doesn’t characterize those prints as having fused different traditions or styles.",

The student asserts that the explanatory notes were included in the republication primarily as a marketing device to help sell the stand-alone volume. Which statement, if true, would most directly support the student’s claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. The text of the poem as published in the quarterly journal is not identical to the text of the poem published in the stand-alone volume.",
    optionB:
      "B. Many critics believe that the poet’s explanatory notes remove certain ambiguities of the poem and make it less interesting as a result.",
    optionC:
      "C. The publishers of the stand-alone volume requested the explanatory notes from the poet in order to make the book attractive to readers who already had a copy\nof the poem in a journal issue.",
    optionD:
      "D. Correspondence between the poet and the publisher reveals that the poet’s explanatory notes went through several drafts.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it would most directly support the student’s claim about the motivation for including explanatory notes with the stand-alone volume of the poem. The text explains that the poem had previously been published without the notes in a quarterly journal. It stands to reason that readers who had purchased the journal issue containing the poem would be unlikely to purchase an unchanged version of the poem in a stand-alone volume. However, the inclusion of notes in that volume would encourage the purchase of a stand-alone volume, since the later text would differ from the original by including the author’s own explanation of the poem. Therefore, if it were true that the publishers of the stand-alone volume had requested the notes to make the book attractive to readers who already had a copy of the journal issue, this fact would support the student’s claim that the notes were included primarily as a marketing device. Choice A is incorrect because the student’s claim is about the motivation for including the explanatory notes in the stand-alone volume, not about changes that might have been made to the poem itself for publication in that volume; moreover, the text never suggests that such changes were made. Choice B is incorrect because the student’s claim is about why the explanatory notes were included in the stand-alone volume, not about how the notes affected readers’ and critics’ subsequent experience of the poem. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that the poet drafted multiple versions of the explanatory notes doesn’t directly address the issue of whether the notes were intended as a marketing device, as the student claims; the correspondence would support this claim only if it showed that the poet had revised the notes specically to make them useful to the marketing of the stand-alone volume.",

      "In 1934 physicist Eugene Wigner posited the existence of a crystal consisting entirely of electrons in a honeycomb-like structure. The so-called Wigner crystal remained largely conjecture, however, until Feng Wang and colleagues announced in 2021 that they had captured an image of one. The researchers trapped electrons between two semiconductors and then cooled the apparatus, causing the electrons to settle into a crystalline structure. By inserting an ultrathin sheet of graphene above the crystal, the researchers obtained an impression—the rst visual conrmation of the Wigner crystal. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Researchers have obtained the most denitive evidence to date of the existence of the Wigner crystal.",
    optionB:
      "B. Researchers have identied an innovative new method for working with unusual crystalline structures.",
    optionC:
      "C. Graphene is the most important of the components required to capture an image of a Wigner crystal.",
    optionD:
      "D. It’s dicult to acquire an image of a Wigner crystal because of the crystal’s honeycomb structure.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, Eugene Wigner hypothesized that a crystal could exist that would be composed of electrons and have a honeycomb-like shape. The text goes on to say that the existence of the Wigner crystal remained unconrmed until Feng Wang and colleagues were able to make an impression of one using two semiconductors and an ultrathin sheet of graphene. Thus, the main idea is that researchers have obtained the most denitive evidence to date of the existence of the Wigner crystal. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on one kind of crystal—the Wigner crystal— and doesn’t discuss crystalline structures in general. And although the text conveys that Wang and colleagues gured out a way to capture an image of a Wigner crystal, it doesn’t address the idea of applying this approach to other types of crystals. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes in general the process Wang and colleagues followed to obtain an impression of the Wigner crystal; it doesn’t address the relative importance of each component in that process. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t state that researchers had a hard time getting an impression of the Wigner crystal because of its honeycomb structure. Nothing in the text indicates why it took so long to prove the existence of this crystal or take an impression of it.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the quotation that most directly illustrates the claim that Cather portrays Alexandra as having a deep emotional connection to her natural surroundings. This quotation states that the country meant a great deal to Alexandra and then goes on to detail several ways in which her natural surroundings affect her emotionally: the insects sound like “the sweetest music,” she feels as though “her heart were hiding” in the grass “with the quail and the plover,” and near the ridges she feels “the future stirring.” Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t suggest that Alexandra had a deep emotional connection to her natural surroundings but instead describes how she interacts with the people around her to learn more about crops, poultry, and experiments with clover hay. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t suggest that Alexandra has a deep emotional connection to her natural surroundings but instead describes her nighttime departure in a wagon.

Barring the possibility of several farmers of the same era independently developing techniques that the Haudenosaunee people had already invented, these facts most strongly suggest that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. those farmers learned the techniques from other people who were more directly inuenced by Haudenosaunee practices.",
    optionB:
      "B. the crops typically cultivated by Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States were not well suited to Haudenosaunee farming techniques.",
    optionC:
      "C. Haudenosaunee farming techniques were widely used in regions outside the northeastern United States.",
    optionD:
      "D. Euro-American farmers only began to recognize the benets of Haudenosaunee farming techniques late in the nineteenth century.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Euro-American farmers’ use of Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques. According to the text, some Euro-American farmers were using these techniques in the early nineteenth century despite few of the farmers having seen Haudenosaunee farms. One explanation for these facts might be that the farmers developed techniques on their own that already had been invented centuries earlier by the Haudenosaunee people, but the text explicitly bars, or rules out, this explanation. If Euro-American farmers didn’t learn these techniques from direct observation of Haudenosaunee practices and didn’t invent the techniques independently, then the most logical explanation is that they learned the techniques from other people who were more directly inuenced by Haudenosaunee practices than the farmers themselves were. Once they learned about Haudenosaunee agricultural practices, Euro-American farmers could then apply those practices to their own farming. Choice B is incorrect because the fact that some Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States were using Haudenosaunee techniques suggests that the techniques were likely useful for the crops the farmers raised, not that the crops typically cultivated by the farmers were not well suited to Haudenosaunee farming techniques. If the farmers’ crops were ill suited to the techniques, it’s unlikely that the farmers would have used those techniques. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates only that Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques were used by Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States, not that these techniques were widely used outside this region. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some Euro-American farmers were using Haudenosaunee farming techniques early in the nineteenth century. This suggests that some Euro-American farmers were beginning to recognize the benets of these techniques near the start of the century, not that such farmers only began to recognize the benets of the techniques much later.",

If participants who saw a panel of three commentators with various views about an issue answered more questions about the issue correctly than did participants who saw a debate, that would support Tannen’s hypothesis since it would show that participants who heard multiple varied perspectives were better informed than were participants who heard a debate between opposing viewpoints. Choice A is incorrect because nding that participants perceived commentators in the debate as more knowledgeable than commentators in the panel is irrelevant to Tannen’s hypothesis, which is that presenting multiple perspectives on an issue is more informative to the audience than presenting opposing views of the issue is.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of potential benets of interruptions in the workplace. The text indicates that a common belief in business is that interruptions to working employees decrease energy and productivity levels. However, the text goes on to explain that a research team led by Harshad Puranik has found that there could be a social benet to these interruptions. Since the team found that workplace interruptions can increase employees’ sense of belonging and job satisfaction, it follows that the interpersonal benets of some interruptions can offset the perceived negative effects. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text presents research ndings that suggest some workplace interruptions can have a positive effect on employee job satisfaction, no further information is presented to suggest at what frequency these interruptions are ideal. Furthermore, the text doesn’t tie workplace interruptions to increased productivity, but rather links it to social benets such as sense of belonging. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t address employees’ motives for choosing not to interrupt their colleagues. The text presents research ndings that suggest that there are some positive interpersonal effects of workplace interruptions that can increase employee job satisfaction. Choice D is incorrect because asking businesses to discourage workplace interruptions doesn’t follow from the team’s research about the benets of workplace interruptions, nor does the text describe an ideal work environment.

The fact that Henry VIII commissioned a survey of church holdings just before enacting the Dissolution of the Monasteries suggests that he was interested in the potential prots from claiming their assets. This supports the historians’ assertion. Choice A is incorrect. This choice describes a potential effect of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The decrease in the proportion of monks in England isn’t relevant to the question of Henry VIII’s motivations. Choice B is incorrect. Details about how the monks were treated during the dissolution don’t address Henry VIII’s motivations for enacting the policy in the rst place. That the monks could keep the content of their cells (their rooms) and sell off the timber they’d harvested has no impact on the value of the monasteries’ estates—their land holdings. Choice D is incorrect. This choice mentions one impact that the Dissolution of the Monasteries contributed to, two years after it happened. But it doesn’t help explain why Henry VIII might have wanted to enact the policy in the rst place.",

Clamshells become thin and eroded as they wash up on the beach, while those on the seaoor are smooth and sturdy, so the research team suspects that Neanderthals prized the tools made with seaoor shells. However, the team also concluded that those tools were likely more challenging to obtain, noting that ______ Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to support the research team’s conclusion?",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the researchers’ conclusion about the harvesting of clamshells by Neanderthals for use as tools. The text explains that Neanderthals used clamshells to make tools and that the sturdiest, and therefore the most desirable, shells for this purpose are found on the seaoor, not on the beach. However, the researchers also concluded that the clamshell tools made from shells from the seaoor are rarer than those made from shells from the beach. Meanwhile the table shows that at each depth, the number of tools made from shells from the beach exceeds the number made from the more desirable shells from the seaoor. The fact that the more desirable shells are less common suggests that it was signicantly more dicult to harvest shells from the seaoor than from the beach. Choice B is incorrect because knowing which depth represents the period of time with the highest Neanderthal population does not help answer the question of why the Neanderthals consistently made more tools from the less desirable shells from the beach than they made from the more desirable shells from the seaoor. Choice C is incorrect because it claims that the beach shells are more durable than the seaoor shells, which contradicts the text’s description of shells from the seaoor as smoother and sturdier than shells from the beach. Choice D is incorrect because knowing which depth has the most artifacts or whether the clam population uctuated does not help explain why tools made from the less desirable shells from the beach outnumber tools made from the more desirable shells from the seaoor.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the quotation that most directly illustrates the claim that Whitman’s poem suggests that its readers haven’t fully understood themselves. This quotation makes that point directly by saying to readers, “You have not known what you are.” The quotation goes on to reinforce this point using a metaphor of sleep, saying that readers have “slumber’d” and that their “eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time.” Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t suggest that readers haven’t fully understood themselves but instead characterizes readers as “immense” and “interminable.” Although immense and interminable things can be dicult to understand, this quotation doesn’t make that point. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t suggest that readers haven’t fully understood themselves but instead conveys the speaker’s regret over not having celebrated readers sooner. In fact, this quotation says nothing at all about readers themselves—it’s focused solely on the speaker’s feelings about readers.

    optionD:
      "D. showed no signicant difference between REM sleep after returning to land and REM sleep while in the water.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. If REM sleep were homeostatically regulated in fur seals, then all the seals would compensate with REM levels signicantly over baseline after going weeks without REM. We’d also expect the seals to maintain those elevated REM levels for some time. Since seals B and C return very quickly to baseline REM levels, this suggests that REM sleep in fur seals may not be regulated homeostatically. Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t support the conclusion. If REM sleep were homeostatically regulated in fur seals, then we’d suspect the seals to sustain REM levels well above baseline for a prolonged period in order to compensate for weeks of REM deprivation while in the water. Whether or not there’s a reduction in REM sleep from day 1 to day 2 doesn’t tell us how REM sleep on those days relates to baseline, which is where our focus should be. Choice B is incorrect. The y-axis of this graph doesn’t depict baseline levels of REM sleep, but rather shows REM sleep as a percent of baseline. Choice D is incorrect. The graph doesn’t depict REM sleep while in the water for the seals in the study.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about the two previously unknown penguin species that is supported by the text. According to the text, Alan Tennyson and colleagues studied fossil bones belonging to two previously unknown penguin species that are described as prehistoric, or ancient. The text goes on to say that one of the two species was considerably larger than the emperor penguin, which is currently the largest penguin in existence. Thus, the text indicates that the other species aren’t in existence today, or that the two previously unknown penguin species are no longer living species. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that Alan Tennyson is a paleontologist who studied the fossils of two previously unknown penguin species, it doesn’t say whether these penguins are frequently studied by paleontologists. Choice C is incorrect because the text says that one of the two previously unknown penguin species was three times larger than the emperor penguin (a penguin alive today), not that they were both smaller than penguin species that exist today.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. The researchers concluded that as we approach maximum plausible surface temperatures, there will be a larger percentage of sites where thermal pollution could contribute to meeting home heating needs. By showing that only a small percentage of homes can currently use thermal pollution for home heating, and that this percentage would grow much larger at maximum plausible surface temperatures, this choice supports the researchers’ conclusion.

Choice B is incorrect. The graph is not depicting need for supplemental heating from thermal pollution, but rather potential to use thermal pollution for supplemental heating. Choice C is incorrect.

    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion that there is a growing interest among CEOs in connecting with more departments in their companies. The graph shows the average number of individuals reporting directly to CEOs during three different time periods: the individuals are divided into managers and department leaders. The average number of department leaders directly reporting to their CEO during the 1991–1995 period was slightly more than three, during the 1996–2001 period it was four, and during the 2001–2008 period it was almost seven. Thus, the average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied, which suggests that CEOs were connecting with more departments. Choice A is incorrect because the average number of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose for both categories between the 1991– 1995 and 2001–2008 periods; thus, it isn’t true that the average numbers didn’t uctuate. Choice B is incorrect because the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 2001–2008 period, not in the 1996–2001 period. Choice C is incorrect. Although it correctly describes a feature of the graph, the observation that more department leaders than managers are reporting to CEOs does not by itself address the question of whether CEOs are connecting with more departments over time—to address that question, one needs to know whether the number of department leaders reporting to CEOs is increasing over time.",

      "Roasted green chiles are a popular ingredient in Southwestern cuisine, but the traditional roasting method of burning propane is not environmentally friendly. To see if solar power could provide a better alternative, engineer Kenneth Armijo and his team roasted batches of green chiles using between 38 and 42 heliostats, which are devices that concentrate sunlight. The team was successful in reaching the same roasting temperature used in traditional propane roasting, but they found that propane yielded faster results. While the fastest solar-roasted green chiles took six minutes, batches using propane took only four. Armijo hypothesizes that they can reduce the roasting time for solar-roasted green chiles by using more heliostats. Which nding, if true, would most directly support Armijo’s hypothesis?",
    optionA:
      "A. The temperature inside the roasting drum is distributed more evenly when roasting green chiles with solar power than with propane.",
    optionB:
      "B. Attempts to roast green chiles using 50 heliostats yields results in fewer than six minutes.",

    optionD:
      "D. The skins of solar-roasted green chiles are easier to peel than the skins of propane-roasted green chiles.",

    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. Armijo believes that using more heliostats will speed up the roasting process, and this nding shows that with 50 heliostats—more than the number of heliostats already used—the roasting time is indeed reduced. Choice A is incorrect. The evenness of temperature in the roasting drum doesn’t tell us about the speed of the roasting process, which is what Armijo’s hypothesis is concerned with. Choice C is incorrect. Armijo’s hypothesis is focused on the speed of the roasting process, not the avor of the resulting roasted chiles. Choice D is incorrect.

      "In superuorescence, electrical charges known as dipoles emit light in synchronized bursts so intense that they are visible to the eye. Until recently, this phenomenon has only been observed at extremely cold temperatures because dipoles cannot synchronize at higher temperatures. But in a study, Melike Biliroglu and colleagues observed superuorescence at room temperature in thin lms made of perovskite and other similarly crystalline materials; the researchers propose that the formation of shock-absorbing quasiparticles called polarons in the material protects dipoles from thermal interference. Based on the text, how are polarons believed to be involved in the superuorescence observed in Biliroglu and colleagues’ study?",
    optionA:
      "A. Polarons enable superuorescent bursts to cross from one crystalline material to another.",
    optionB:
      "B. Polarons allow for the dipoles to synchronize despite higher temperatures.",
    optionC:
      "C. Polarons accelerate the dipoles’ release of superuorescent bursts.",
    optionD: "D. Polarons decrease the intensity of the superuorescent burst.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes Biliroglu and colleagues’ claim about how the polarons function in relation to superuorescence. The text indicates that “until recently,” superuorescence (intense, synchronized bursts of light emitted by dipoles) has solely been observed at very cold temperatures. However, it also states that, recently, Biliroglu and colleagues report observing the phenomenon at room temperature. They achieved this using “thin lms made of perovskite and other similarly crystalline materials,” which the researchers claim allows for the formation of polarons. They also suggest that these polarons might absorb the thermal shocks that typically disrupt dipole synchronization at warmer temperatures. Thus, based on the text, Biliroglu and colleagues believe that polarons help dipoles synchronize at temperatures well above those at which superuorescence had previously been observed. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the prospect of a superuorescent burst moving between crystalline materials or any other mediums. Choice C is incorrect because the text’s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superuorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. Rather than suggesting that polarons speed up superuorescent bursts, the text suggests that no superuorescence can occur at room temperature in the absence of polarons. Thus, the text indicates that polarons make superuorescent bursts more likely to occur at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed, not that polarons accelerate the bursts. Choice D is incorrect because the text’s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superuorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. In the absence of polarons, the text suggests there would be no superuorescence at room temperature. Thus, rather than decrease the intensity of superuorescent bursts, polarons make them more likely to occur under certain circumstances.",

In the quotation, Alexandra is described as enjoying looking at the stars and feeling a “sense of personal security” when she contemplates nature’s order and its governing laws.

      "Choice A is the best answer. The claim is that when winds are stronger than forecasted, wind turbines can generate more energy than predicted. The supporting graph shows the additional amount (above the predicted amount) that the turbines generated under those conditions, with the West generating about 150 thousand additional MWh. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t complete the example. The graph shows the additional amount of electricity that the wind turbines generated. The West bar is greater than 0, so the West generated more than the predicted amount. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t complete the example. The graph shows the additional amount of electricity that the wind turbines generated. The West bar is greater than 0, so the West generated more than the predicted amount. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. The graph shows us that the West (the bar on the left) generated about 150 thousand additional MWh.",

      "The domestic sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) descends from a wild plant native to South America. It also populates the Polynesian Islands, where evidence conrms that Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples were cultivating the plant centuries before seafaring rst occurred over the thousands of miles of ocean separating them from South America. To explain how the sweet potato was rst introduced in Polynesia, botanist Pablo Muñoz-Rodríguez and colleagues analyzed the DNA of numerous varieties of the plant, concluding that Polynesian varieties diverged from South American ones over 100,000 years ago. Given that Polynesia was peopled only in the last three thousand years, the team concluded that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA: "A. ",
    optionB:
      "B. Polynesian peoples likely acquired the sweet potato from South American peoples only within the last three thousand years.",
    optionC:
      "C. human activity likely played no role in the introduction of the sweet potato in Polynesi",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the sweet potato in Polynesia. The text indicates that the sweet potato is found in Polynesia but originated in South America, and that the sweet potato was being cultivated by Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples in Polynesia long before sea voyages between South America and Polynesia began. The text goes on to note that research by Muñoz-Rodríguez and colleagues has established that the Polynesian varieties of sweet potato split from South American varieties more than 100,000 years ago, which is thousands of years before humans settled in Polynesia. If Polynesian peoples were cultivating the sweet potato before sea voyages between Polynesia and South America began, and if Polynesian varieties of sweet potato diverged from South American varieties well before people were in Polynesia, it can reasonably be concluded that humans didn’t play a role in bringing the sweet potato to Polynesia. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t provide any information about when the sweet potato began to be cultivated in South America, so there’s no support for the conclusion that cultivation began in Polynesia before it began in South America. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the sweet potato was being cultivated in Polynesia long before sea journeys between Polynesia and South America began. Therefore, it wouldn’t be reasonable to conclude that Polynesian peoples acquired the sweet potato from South American peoples. Additionally, the text indicates that the Polynesian varieties of sweet potato diverged from the South American varieties thousands of years before people settled in Polynesia, which suggests that the sweet potato was already present in Polynesia when people arrived. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that the domestic sweet potato, which is found in Polynesia, descends from a wild South American plant, not from a domesticated South American plant. The only people that the text describes as cultivating the sweet potato are Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples of Polynesia.",

      "Microbes that live in shallow lakes and ponds produce methane, a harmful greenhouse gas. Ecologist Ralf Aben and his team wanted to see how different types of shallow-water plants might affect the amount of methane that escapes into the atmosphere. Aben’s team set up some water tanks with soil and microbes from local ponds. Some tanks had a type of underwater plant that grows in the soil called watermilfoil. Other tanks had either duckweed, a type of plant that oats on the water’s surface, or algae. Aben and his team found that tanks with duckweed and algae released higher levels of methane than tanks with watermilfoil did. This nding suggests that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. the presence of some kinds of underwater plants like watermilfoil helps prevent methane from escaping shallow lakes and ponds.",
    optionB:
      "B. shallow lakes and ponds release more methane than deeper bodies of water because shallow bodies of water usually have more plants than deep bodies of\nwater do.",

    optionD:
      "D. having a mix of algae, underwater plants, and oating plants is the best way to reduce the amount of methane in shallow lakes and ponds.",

    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. The passage tells us that “tanks with duckweed (a oating plant) and algae released higher levels of methane than tanks with watermilfoil (an underwater plant) did.” This suggests that the presence of some kinds of underwater plants like watermilfoil may help prevent methane from escaping shallow lakes and ponds. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention deeper bodies of water at all, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn’t compare the likelihood of shallow lakes and ponds containing algae, watermilfoil, or duckweed. Choice D is incorrect.

      "Sandra Cisneros’s 1984 novella The House on Mango Street made a lasting impact on US literature. Its depiction of Mexican American culture inspired later authors to examine their own heritage within their ctional works. Also inuential was the book’s portrayal of the main character, Esperanza, during a pivotal year of her youth. This insightful depiction of a preteen girl encouraged authors who, like Cisneros herself, are Latina to use ctional works to examine experiences from their own youth. Which statement, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence?",

      "A. In interviews, a number of Latina authors say that The House on Mango Street inspired them to write about their own adolescence in their novels.",

    optionD:
      "D. Since 1984, new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors have often been compared to The House on Mango Street.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence. The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros’s The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros’s novella was also inuential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character’s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use ction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella inuenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood. Choice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn’t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren’t Latina were also likely inuenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella’s inuence on Latina authors specically, the nding that the book also inuenced authors who weren’t Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the nding that The House on Mango Street has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn’t relate directly to the text’s claim that the novella has inuenced Latina authors specically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros’s The House on Mango Street would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros’s novella, such similarities wouldn’t necessarily be evidence of the novella’s inuence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities. Testimony from younger Latina authors about how The House on Mango Street had inspired them would be far more persuasive evidence of the novella’s inuence.",

    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Zelda Fitzgerald’s contributions to literature. The text begins by saying that many scholars view Zelda mainly in terms of her marriage to F. Scott Fitzgerald and “don’t recognize Zelda as a writer in her own right.” The text then mentions a novel and “numerous short stories” that she wrote and that such scholars tend to ignore. Therefore, those scholars who focus on Zelda only as an inspiration for F. Scott’s writings risk misrepresenting the full range of Zelda’s contributions to literature. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does mention that Zelda Fitzgerald “likely inuenced” her husband’s literary work, its focus is on Zelda’s own writing, not on her husband’s writing or factors that might have inuenced it. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not discuss F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald’s opinions of each other’s works. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does suggest that F.

According to an analysis of 11,000 such networks, Rylan Schaeffer and colleagues advise caution when drawing conclusions about brains from observations of neural networks. They found that when attempting to mimic grid cells (brain cells used in navigation), while 90% of the networks could accomplish navigation-related tasks, only about 10% of those exhibited any behaviors similar to those of grid cells. But even this approximation of grid-cell activity has less to do with similarity between the neural networks and biological brains than it does with the rules programmed into the networks.

Gardner and colleagues used satellite data to determine the dominant visible wavelengths of light measured for various segments of these rivers. The researchers classied wavelengths of 495 nanometers (nm) and below as red, wavelengths between 495 and 560 nm as blue, and wavelengths of 560 nm and above as yellow.

      "D. Segments of the Missouri River owing into lakes typically had dominant wavelengths of light above 560 nm, while segments owing out of lakes typically had\ndominant wavelengths below 560 nm.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support Gardner and colleagues’ conclusion that segments of the Missouri River owing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than do segments of the river owing out of lakes. The text says that rivers appear yellow when they contain a lot of sediment and appear red when they contain a lot of algae. It goes on to explain that Gardner and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light for different segments of rivers in the United States and classied those wavelength measurements into colors: red for wavelengths of 495 nanometers and below, blue for wavelengths between 495 and 560 nanometers, and yellow for wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above. Combined with the earlier information about river colors, this suggests that rivers rich in sediment will have wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above (since such rivers appear yellow). If researchers found that Missouri River segments owing into lakes tend to have wavelengths above 560 nanometers and segments owing out of lakes tend to have wavelengths below 560 nanometers, this nding would support Gardner and colleagues’ conclusion, since it would suggest that the river tends to carry more sediment when it ows into lakes than when it ows out of lakes. Choice A is incorrect because nding that sections of the Missouri River with high chlorophyll-a levels have wavelengths between 490 and 560 nanometers would be irrelevant to the researchers’ conclusion that segments of the river owing into lakes are richer in sediment than are segments of the river owing out of lakes. This nding would not indicate anything about segments owing into or out of lakes. Choice B is incorrect because nding that lakes through which the Missouri River passes have higher wavelengths near their shores than in the center would not support the researchers’ conclusion that segments of the river owing into lakes have more sediment than segments owing out of lakes. This nding would suggest only that there is more sediment around the edges of lakes than in their centers, which does not have any direct bearing on the researchers’ conclusion about river segments owing into and out of lakes. Choice C is incorrect because nding that most segments of the Missouri River have wavelengths signicantly higher than 560 nanometers would suggest that most segments of the river are high in sediment, not that segments owing into lakes are higher in sediment than segments owing out of lakes. Only a comparison of river segments owing into lakes with segments owing out of lakes can support the researchers’ conclusion.",

    optionD:
      "D. a knuckle-walking human ancestor could have easily moved bipedally in trees.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the evolution of bipedalism in humans. According to the text, one potential explanation for humans walking upright on two legs is that the behavior evolved from an ancestor that mostly stayed on the ground and walked on four limbs, as modern chimpanzees and gorillas do. However, the nding that orangutans, also a relative of humans, sometimes stand on two legs in trees while using their arms to balance and reach for fruits suggests another possible explanation: perhaps a tree-dwelling ancestor of humans began moving on two legs because it offered an advantage, such as access to certain foods. Choice B is incorrect because the nding that modern orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn’t offer any insight into when either bipedalism or tree-climbing behavior emerged in human ancestors. Additionally, the text indicates that one theory is that bipedalism evolved from a mostly ground-based ancestor that was already practicing knuckle-walking, not that bipedalism and knuckle-walking developed at the same time. Choice C is incorrect because the nding that orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn’t offer any insight into how dicult it would’ve been to move between the ground and the trees without bipedalism; there’s no suggestion that climbing or moving in trees depends on the ability to walk on two legs rather than four, even if that ability might be helpful in certain circumstances. Choice D is incorrect because the nding that orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn’t suggest that a knuckle-walking human ancestor could’ve easily moved on two legs in trees. Although the text indicates that bipedalism may have evolved from a human ancestor that mostly stayed on the ground and walked on four limbs, it gives no indication of how easy it would’ve been for such an ancestor to move bipedally in trees.",

Until 2014, these stories were copyrighted. The right to adapt was only available to those who could afford the copyright fee and gain approval from the strict copyright holders of Doyle’s estate. Some journalists predict that the number of Sherlock Holmes adaptations is likely to increase since the end of copyright means that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA: "A. Doyle’s original stories will become hard to n",
    optionB:
      "B. people will become more interested in detective stories than they were in the 1800s.",
    optionC: "C. producing adaptations will become easier and less expensive.",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. The text tells us that because of the copyright, adapting Sherlock Holmes stories used to be expensive and dicult. This suggests that after the copyright ends, it will be less expensive and less dicult to adapt these stories. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never suggests that the copyright ending will make Sherlock Holmes stories harder to nd. Instead, it suggests that adaptations of these stories will be easier and less expensive to make. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses people’s interest in detective stories, so there is no basis to make this inference. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never suggests that copyright fees from the past are returned after a copyright ends, so there is no basis to make this inference.",

    question:
      "As media consumption has become increasingly multiplatform and socially mediated, active news acquisition has diminished in favor of an attitude known as “news nds me” (NFM), in which people passively rely on their social networks and ambient media environments for information about current events. Homero Gil de Zúñiga and Trevor Diehl examined data on a representative group of adults in the United States to determine participants’ strength of NFM attitude, political knowledge, and political interest. Although no major election took place suciently near the study for Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl to identify causality between NFM and voting behavior, they did posit that NFM may reduce voting probability through an indirect effect. Which nding, if true, would most directly support the idea advanced by Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl?",
    optionA:
      "A. NFM attitude tends to increase in strength as major elections approach, and people are signicantly more likely to vote in major elections than in minor\nelections.",
    optionB:
      "B. NFM attitude has a strong negative effect on political knowledge and interest, and there is known to be a strong positive correlation between political\nknowledge and interest and the likelihood of voting.",
    optionC:
      "C. Political interest is known to have a strong positive effect on likelihood of voting but shows only a weak positive effect on political knowledge, and NFM attitude\nshows little correlation with either political knowledge or political interest.",
    optionD:
      "D. The likelihood of voting increases as political knowledge increases, and the relationship between NFM attitude and political knowledge tends to strengthen as\nthe size of people’s social networks increases.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would most directly support the idea advanced by Homero Gil de Zúñiga and Trevor Diehl that NFM ("news nds me") attitude may reduce voting probability through an indirect effect. The text describes NFM as an attitude that has lowered people’s interest in actively acquiring news and introduces Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl’s study on the effects of NFM on people in the United States’ political knowledge and interest. The text goes on to say that despite the fact that the study didn’t occur near a major election, Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl still conclude that NFA may reduce voting probability. If the likelihood, or probability, that a person will vote is linked to that person’s level of political knowledge and interest, that would suggest that negatively affecting a person’s level of political knowledge and interest would also negatively affect how likely that person is to vote. Thus, if NFM attitude has a negative effect on political knowledge and interest, then it would also likely reduce voting probability. Choice A is incorrect because the nding that NFM attitude increases as major elections approach wouldn’t address the effect of NFM on the likelihood of voting, which is the idea advanced by Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl. Moreover, although the text mentions that there were no major elections that occurred near the time of the study, it doesn’t discern between major and minor elections when discussing voting probability. Choice C is incorrect because nding that NFM attitude shows little correlation with either political knowledge or political interest would undermine, not support, Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl’s idea that NFM may reduce voting probability because it suggests that NFM has no effect on political knowledge or political interest. Choice D is incorrect. Although Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl’s idea would be supported by the nding that the likelihood of voting increases as political knowledge increases, nothing in the text suggests that the researchers’ idea hinges on the size of people’s social networks.',

By giving reminders to “care for the cat, the birds, and the owers,” “not eat too quickly,” and avoid engaging in strenuous activity in the heat, Mrs. Spring Fragrance shows that she’s thinking about what’s happening at home and wants to ensure everything is taken care of. Choice A is incorrect because the quotation, while it does suggest that Mrs. Spring Fragrance has made fudge at home before, is focused on preparations for an upcoming festival, not on concerns for anything happening at home while Mrs. Spring Fragrance is away. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation has to do with an upcoming event during Mrs. Spring Fragrance’s trip—visiting San José and meeting someone new—rather than her concern for what’s happening at home.

      "Although it’s clear that Mars once had liquid water on its surface, astronomers have debated whether the evidence of ancient water reects a prolonged phase of warm, wet conditions—the so-called wet and warm scenario—or a brief period of melting in an otherwise consistently frozen environment. Researchers Benjamin T. Cardenas and Michael P. Lamb recently added to this debate by using data from NASA and the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter to map the topography of what is now a large basin in Mars’s northern hemisphere. Cardenas and Lamb concluded that the wet and warm scenario is likely correct. Which nding about the basin, if true, would most directly support Cardenas and Lamb’s conclusion?",

    optionD:
      "D. It is surrounded by channels that could have been formed either by running water or by owing lav",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. This choice provides direct support for the researchers’ conclusion. If the basin once held an ocean of liquid water for "an extended time," that supports the "wet and warm scenario" on Mars, which involved a "prolonged" period of temperate conditions (and not just a "brief period of melting"). Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t provide support for the researchers’ conclusions. The dimensions of the basin have little bearing on whether or not it was lled with liquid water, and for how long, and that’s the evidence that would support the "wet and warm" theory. Similarly, whether or not the basin was formed by an asteroid or a comet is irrelevant to the question of whether or not there was water in the basin for a long period. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not provide support for the researchers’ conclusions, but rather the opposite. A "massive but short lived inux" of liquid water is not the same as a "prolonged phase of warm, wet conditions." It more reects the opposing theory, a "brief period of melting." Choice D is incorrect. This choice does not support Cardenas and Lamb’s conclusion. Both theories about liquid water on Mars ("wet and warm" and "brief period of melting") involve owing water, but lava isn’t mentioned at all in the text. Therefore, this choice doesn’t provide exclusive support for either theory.',

    optionB: "B. a longer footprint, and a shorter average stride.",
    optionC: "C. a shorter footprint, and a longer average stride.",
    optionD: "D. a shorter footprint, and a shorter average stride.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the claim about the tracks left by two therapods. The table indicates that the set of tracks labeled La Torre 6A has an estimated footprint length of 32.8 centimeters, an average stride length of 5.23 meters, and an estimated mean speed of 6.5–10.3 meters per second. For the set of tracks labeled La Torre 6B, on the other hand, the estimated footprint length is 28.9 centimeters, the average stride length is 5.57 meters, and the estimated mean speed is 8.8–12.4 meters per second. Therefore, the therapod that left the La Torre 6B tracks had a shorter footprint and a longer average stride than the one that left the La Torre 6A tracks. Choice A is incorrect. While it is true that of the two therapods, the one that left the La Torre 6B tracks had a longer average stride, it didn’t have a longer footprint: the table shows that its estimated footprint length is 28.9 centimeters, while La Torre 6A’s estimated footprint length is 32.8 centimeters. Choice B is incorrect because the table shows that of the two therapods, the one that left the La Torre 6B tracks had a footprint length estimated at 28.9 centimeters, which is shorter than the 32.8 centimeters estimated for the other set of tracks. Moreover, the therapod that left the La Torre 6B tracks had a longer average stride, not shorter: 5.57 meters, compared with 5.23 meters for the other set of tracks. Choice D is incorrect. While it is true that of the two therapods, the one that left the La Torre 6B tracks had a shorter footprint, it didn’t have a shorter average stride: the table shows that its average stride length is 5.57 meters, while La Torre 6A’s average stride length is 5.23 meters.",

The researchers have concluded that the area was once a nesting and breeding site for titanosaurs, a group of sauropod dinosaurs. The nding is signicant given the previous lack of known nesting sites in northern regions of South America, which led many paleontologists to assume that titanosaurs migrated south to lay eggs.

    optionD:
      "D. It is farther north than any other nesting site discovered in South Americ",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about the site discovered by the researchers that is supported by the text. The text discusses Fiorelli and colleagues’ discovery of egg clutches, single eggs, and eggshells in a Brazilian mine. According to the text, the presence of these eggs, which are from the Late Cretaceous period, led the researchers to conclude that the location was once a nesting and breeding site for titanosaurs. The text then explains that the nding is important because of the “previous lack of known nesting sites in northern regions of South America.” If there haven’t been any other discoveries of a nesting site in South America’s northern regions and the site in the Brazilian mine is the rst, then the text strongly suggests that the site is farther north than other nesting sites that have been discovered in South America. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the site discovered by Fiorelli and colleagues is the earliest titanosaur nesting and breeding site known to paleontologists but rather that it’s the rst nesting site found in northern regions of South America. Moreover, the text doesn’t suggest how the timeline of the newly discovered site compares with that of other titanosaur nesting and breeding sites. Choice B is incorrect because there is no mention in the text about any diculties that Fiorelli and colleagues faced when they were excavating the nesting and breeding site in the Brazilian mine. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t support the idea that the nesting and breeding site in the Brazilian mine was occupied by sauropods other than titanosaurs.

With each generation, small differences are introduced that result in distinct variations—called dialects—among geographically isolated populations of the same species. A research study examined whether twelve-day-old Ficedula hypoleuca (pied ycatcher) nestlings prefer local dialects over the unfamiliar dialects of nonlocal F. hypoleuca populations: the more begging calls the nestlings made in response to a song, the stronger their preference.

    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. Because “song preference plays a role in songbird mate selection,” and because F. hypoleuca nestlings display a preference for local dialects, we can infer that they will be more likely to choose mates from local populations. Choice A is incorrect. We don’t have any information suggesting that this preference disappears, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. Zheng’s claim is that the idea of world music “homogenizes” (meaning makes similar) distinct kinds of music by reducing them to one category. In other words, Zheng thinks the concept of world music is a harmful oversimplication of diverse musical forms. To support this claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so different from one another that they should not fall into the same category. If it’s true that mbaqanga and quan họ developed separately and have little in common musically, then it wouldn’t make sense to lump them into the same category. Choice B is incorrect. If true, this wouldn’t affect the claim. To support the claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so different from one another that they should not fall into the same category. A difference in popularity doesn’t necessarily mean that the two musical traditions shouldn’t be categorized together: instead, we need to know if the music itself is similar or different. Choice C is incorrect. If true, this wouldn’t affect the claim. To support the claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so different from each other that they should not fall into the same category. This choice doesn’t do that. Choice D is incorrect. If true, this would actually weaken the claim. Zheng thinks it’s reductive or oversimplifying to put distinct musical traditions into a single category.

      "D. will nd it dicult to identify a group of people who can function as an appropriate control group for their studies.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the challenge researchers face when studying the effects of holding elected oce on a person’s behavior. The text explains that it’s hard for researchers to test for the effects that elected oce has on people because nding people to serve as a control group is dicult. The text indicates that a control group needs to be made up of people who share characteristics of the group being tested but don’t have the variable being tested (in this case, holding elected oce). Because researchers aren’t able to inuence who wins elections, they’re also unable to determine who would serve as an appropriately similar member of a control group. Thus, it logically follows that researchers will nd it dicult to identify a group of people who can function as an appropriate control group for their studies. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on the struggle to put together a control group for experiments; it doesn’t suggest that nding information about politicians’ behavior is dicult. Choice B is incorrect because the experiments mentioned in the text are testing the effects of holding elected oce on a person’s behavior. Studying people who have already held elected oce wouldn’t provide an opportunity to note any behavioral changes that the position might cause. Choice C is incorrect because the text denes people in a control group as those “who are otherwise similar to the oce-holders”; selecting people who differ from the oce-holders wouldn’t t the criteria for an appropriate control group.",

For the orchestra’s iConduct! program, Johnson invites community members to learn some basic elements of conducting and then experience conducting the Black Pearl orchestra themselves. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. The Black Pearl orchestra performs music from all over the world but mostly performs music composed by Philadelphians.",
    optionB:
      "B. Johnson founded the Black Pearl orchestra to perform classical music by contemporary artist Jessie Montgomery.",
    optionC:
      "C. The Black Pearl orchestra gives community members the chance to both listen to and participate in classical music performance.",
    optionD:
      "D. Johnson has community members conduct an orchestra to demonstrate how dicult the task is.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by stating that the Black Pearl orchestra performs classical music, and then goes on to explain that the orchestra offers an iConduct! program. According to the text, this program offers community members the opportunity to learn some basics about conducting and then apply what they learn by conducting the orchestra themselves. Thus, the main idea of the text is that community members can both listen to and participate in a classical music performance. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that the Black Pearl orchestra is based in Philadelphia, it doesn’t indicate that most of the music it plays was composed by Philadelphians. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does state that Johnson founded the Black Pearl orchestra, this is just a detail and not the main focus of the text. Moreover, while the text does say that the orchestra sometimes plays music by Montgomery, it doesn’t assert that the orchestra was founded solely for the purpose of performing Montgomery’s work. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text explains that community members are invited to conduct the Black Pearl orchestra after participating in the iConduct! program, the text doesn’t indicate that Johnson allows community members to do this for the specic purpose of showing how dicult the task is.",

      "One aspect of in-person shopping that online shopping can’t replicate is the opportunity to touch a product before buying it. Does this difference matter? In an experiment, researchers asked one group of participants to touch a mug and a toy, while another group was prohibited from touching the two items. The participants were then asked how much money they’d pay for the items. People who got to touch the items were willing to pay much more money for them than were people who weren’t allowed to touch the items. This nding suggests that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. people who mainly shop online probably spend more money every month than people who mainly shop in person do.",
    optionB:
      "B. in-person shopping may make products seem more valuable than they seem if only viewed online.",
    optionC:
      "C. retailers with in-person and online stores should charge the same price for a given product in both places.",
    optionD:
      "D. online retailers may be able to raise the prices they charge for products that are only available online.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. The text tells us that “people who got to touch the items were willing to pay much more money for them than people who weren’t allowed to touch” them. This suggests that being able to interact with a product in person may make it seem more valuable to a shopper. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss how much people spend each month, so there’s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, since being able to touch a product tends to make people “willing to pay much more money” for it, we might predict that an online shopper would be willing to spend less on the same purchases as an in-person shopper. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss what retailers “should charge,” so there’s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, the study in the text suggests that in-person stores may actually be able to charge more for a given product, since shoppers can touch it. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss products that are only available online, so there’s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, products only available online would still have the problem of shoppers not being able to touch them, and the study suggests that this lowers the prices shoppers are willing to pay.",

    question:
      "Elizabeth Asiedu has identied a negative correlation between the share of developing countries’ economies derived from natural-resource extraction and those countries’ receipts of foreign investment. This may appear counterintuitive—resource extraction requires initial investments (in extractive technology, for instance) at scales best met by multinational corporations—but Asiedu notes that natural-resource industries’ boom-bust cycle can destabilize local currencies and increase developing countries’ vulnerability to external shocks, creating levels of uncertainty to which foreign investors are typically averse. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Although it may seem surprising that foreign investment declines in developing countries as natural-resource extraction makes up a larger share of those\ncountries’ economies, that decline happens because resource extraction requires initial investments too large for foreign investors to supply.",
    optionB:
      "B. Although developing countries tend to become less dependent on foreign investment as natural-resource industries make up a larger share of their economies,\nthis change may not occur if the boom-bust cycle of those industries destabilizes local currencies or increases countries’ vulnerability to external shocks.",
    optionC:
      "C. Although one might expect that foreign investment would increase as natural-resource extraction makes up a larger share of developing countries’ economies,\nthe opposite happens because heavy reliance on natural resources can lead to unattractive conditions for investors.",
    optionD:
      "D. Although foreign investors tend to avoid initial investments in natural-resource industries in developing countries, foreign investment may increase signicantly\nas those industries stabilize and the risks associated with them decline.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, contrary to what some might expect, foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction. The text explains that high reliance on naturalresource extraction can subject a developing country to economic shocks that can destabilize the local currency and introduce economic uncertainty that tends to keep investors away. In other words, although we may think otherwise, foreign investors are less willing to invest in projects in developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on natural-resource extraction because those economies tend to exhibit instability that investors want to avoid. Choice A is incorrect. The text does indicate that foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on naturalresource extraction; the text further indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) for which there are fewer investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think. But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial investments as a reason why foreign investment is less widely available than some might think. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that greater dependence on natural-resource extraction makes a developing country less appealing to foreign investors because of associated economic instability. Rather than arguing that the goal of developing countries is to become less dependent on foreign investment, as the phrasing of choice B suggests, the text focuses only on why foreign investors become less involved with such countries, which suggests that more investment would be preferable. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that naturalresource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) and that there are fewer likely investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think, the text does not address what investors are likely to do over time as the industry stabilizes itself.",

    optionD:
      "D. “There is never-ending pleasure in making one’s self familiar with such a region.”",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that the narrator prefers her hometown to other places she has visited. In the quotation, the narrator compares how she feels about places she has traveled to how she feels about the town she’s from. The narrator states that although the many journeys she has made in her lifetime have brought her much pleasure, she has gained the most enjoyment from her experiences inside the borders of her hometown. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn’t express that the narrator likes her hometown better than other places she has visited; instead, the quotation describes something unspecied in positive terms, saying it continues to offer new things to explore and remember. Choice B is incorrect. Although the quotation praises a landscape surrounding a village, it doesn’t specify that this village is the narrator’s hometown, nor does it express a preference for this village over other places the narrator has visited.

    optionD: "D. the lowest temperature for both Ramah and Tuba City was 50°.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement, providing an example of how the people of the Navajo Nation can experience different climate conditions depending on where they live. The table shows the average highest temperatures and average lowest temperatures in four locations in the Navajo Nation in July. According to the table, Ramah’s average highest temperature for July was 83°, whereas Cameron’s average highest temperature was much higher, at 99°. This difference illustrates the statement that the people of the Navajo Nation can experience different climate conditions depending on where they live. Choice A is incorrect because it states that Cameron and Teec Nos Pos had the same average lowest temperature (65°) for July, which suggests a similarity in climate conditions in those locations rather than a difference. Choice B is incorrect because it misrepresents the data from the table, which shows that the average highest temperature in July for Tuba City was 83°, not 94°, and for Teec Nos Pos it was 94°, not 93°. Even if the cited data accurately reected the data in the table, the similarity between the two values for average highest temperature would suggest that people in the two locations likely experience similar climate conditions, not different climate conditions. Choice D is incorrect because it states that Ramah and Tuba City had the same average lowest temperature (50°) for July, which suggests a similarity in climate conditions in those locations rather than a difference.",

    optionD:
      "D. be dispassionate as they think critically about the social and political questions raised by the play.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. Churchill’s play was inuenced by Brecht’s belief that theater should elicit an intellectual rather than an emotional response from audiences, making them think about social and political issues that also exist outside of the play. Therefore, it makes sense that Churchill would strive to have audiences think dispassionately (i.e., without emotion) and critically about the social and political questions raised by the play. Choice A is incorrect. The passage mentions that Churchill was inuenced by Brecht’s belief that plays should provoke audience members “to consider social and political realities that extend beyond the characters and events depicted onstage,” so there’s no basis for an inference about audience members deeply engaging with characters’ beliefs and actions. Choice B is incorrect. Reecting on things that aren’t related to patriarchy and colonialism wouldn’t “engage audiences in an interrogation of patriarchy and colonialism.” That creates a confusing contradiction. Choice C is incorrect. No mention is made of social and political issues in Germany during Brecht’s time, so there’s no basis for this inference.",

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about what the narrator is doing that is directly supported by the text. According to the text, as the narrator walks across the stage to her piano, she recalls her teacher’s advice to pretend that she is playing for only one person. The text indicates that this advice was intended to help manage any nerves related to performing. Moreover, the text implies that the narrator follows this advice by deciding to focus on her father sitting in the audience. Thus, the text supports the idea that as she walks across the stage, the narrator follows her teacher’s advice about managing her nervousness.

      "Several scholars have argued that conditions in England in the late ninth through early eleventh centuries—namely, burgeoning literacy amid running conicts between England’s Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and Danish invaders—were especially conducive to the production of the Old English epic poem Beowulf, and they have dated the poem’s composition accordingly. It is not inconceivable that Beowulf emerged from such a context, but privileging contextual t over the linguistic evidence of an eighth- or even seventh-century composition requires a level of justication that thus far has not been presented.

    optionD:
      "D. Although the claim of a late ninth- through early eleventh-century composition date for Beowulf has some plausibility, advocates for the claim have not\ncompellingly addressed evidence suggesting an earlier date.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text states that some scholars have dated the composition of Beowulf to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries due to the poem’s t with that period’s historical context. The text goes on to say that while it is “not inconceivable that Beowulf emerged from such a context”—that is, it is possible that Beowulf was composed during the late ninth through eleventh centuries—there is linguistic evidence that the poem was composed earlier, in the seventh or eighth century. According to the text, favoring the historical context over the linguistic evidence requires justication that scholars have not yet supplied. In other words, the text suggests that scholars who favor the later composition date need to explain why the poem’s t with historical context should take precedence over the linguistic evidence, but they have not yet done so. Thus, the main idea of the text is that while there is some plausibility to the later composition date, advocates for the later date have not compellingly addressed evidence suggestive of an earlier date. Choice A is incorrect because the text says that scholars who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries have failed to account for the linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier, not that the evidence those scholars cite in favor of their view is unreliable or that anyone has cast doubt on that evidence. In other words, the text does not suggest that there are problems with the evidence cited by advocates of the later composition date, only that there is other evidence of an earlier composition date that those advocates need to consider. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that those scholars who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries are giving priority to a controversial view of the social conditions at that time. The text makes no reference to any controversy about how scholars interpret that historical period. Instead, the text suggests that scholars who date the poem on the basis of its t with the historical context of England in the late ninth through early eleventh centuries have failed to account for linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how well the poem ts the historical context of England in the seventh and eighth centuries, let alone that it ts that historical context as well as it ts the historical context of the late ninth through early eleventh centuries. Rather, the text says that there is linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed in the seventh or eighth century.",

      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about Dorian that is directly supported by the text. The narrator of the text says that when Dorian sees his portrait, “his cheeks ushed for a moment with pleasure” and “a look of joy came into his eyes.” The narrator goes on to say that Dorian looked at the portrait “in wonder” and presents him as being so entranced by the portrait that he doesn’t notice what Hallward is saying to him. All these details support the description of Dorian as being delighted by what he sees in the portrait. Choice A is incorrect because Dorian isn’t depicted as interested in Hallward’s opinion of the portrait but rather as so enraptured by the painting that he’s hardly even aware of Hallward. Choice C is incorrect because the portrait of Dorian is the only painting that is mentioned in the text, so there’s no evidence that Dorian prefers portraits to other types of paintings.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents data from the table that most effectively complete the statement about the rates at which employment shifted in France and the United States. The text states that over the last two hundred years employment in the agricultural sector has declined while employment in the service sector has risen in both France and the US, and the data from the table reect these trends. The text asserts, however, that the transition from agriculture to services “happened at very different rates in the two countries.” This assertion is best supported by a comparison of data from 1900 and 1950: the table shows that in those years, employment in agriculture went from 43% to 32% in France (a decline of 11 percentage points) and from 41% to 14% in the US (a decline of 27 percentage points), and that employment in services went from 28% to 35% in France (an increase of 7 percentage points) and from 31% to 53% in the US (an increase of 22 percentage points). In other words, the rate of change was greater in the US than in France for both sectors. Choice B is incorrect because comparing the data for 1800 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries, not very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 64% in 1800 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 68% in 1800 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 14% in 1800 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 13% in 1800 to 80% in 2012 in the US. Choice C is incorrect because comparing the data for 1900 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries rather than very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 43% in 1900 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 41% in 1900 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 28% in 1900 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 31% in 1900 to 80% in 2012 in the US.

      "For centuries, the widespread acknowledgment of the involvement of the cerebellum—a dense brain structure in vertebrates—in coordinating motor control in humans has hindered recognition of other possible functions of the structure. Neuroscience research from the last two decades now suggests that the cerebellum regulates emotion and social behavior, and recent research by Ilaria Carta and colleagues has identied a pathway connecting the cerebellum to a center for motivation and reward processing known as the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. The recent verication of a pathway between the VTA and the cerebellum conrms the cerebellum’s long-suspected role in motor coordination.",
    optionB:
      "B. Recent advances in the eld of neuroscience have challenged widely accepted claims about the function of a pathway connecting the VTA and the cerebellum.",
    optionC:
      "C. The cerebellum has primarily been thought to regulate motor functioning, but in recent years neuroscience researchers have been uncovering additional\nfunctions.",
    optionD:
      "D. Technological limitations have historically hindered the study of the cerebellum, but the recent development of new technologies has led to greater insights into\nits functions.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. The text says that the cerebellum has long been thought to regulate motor functioning, but new research shows that it may also have other functions—including regulating emotion and social behavior and some connection to motivation and rewards processing. Choice A is incorrect. The VTA is described as “a center for motivation and reward processing,” and the discovery of the pathway between the VTA and the cerebellum supports the theory that the cerebellum is involved in functions other than motor coordination. Choice B is incorrect. The text says that recent research has identied this pathway, but it doesn’t discuss any previous “widely accepted claims” about the pathway’s function. The “widespread acknowledgement” mentioned early in the passage is about the cerebellum alone, not its connection to the VTA. Choice D is incorrect. The text never discusses any technological limitations or any new technologies.",

When comparing trends in Anchorage and Fairbanks, the student concludes that the two cities show a similar pattern in the monthly hours of sunshine from April to September. Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the student’s conclusion?",

    optionD:
      "D. Anchorage and Fairbanks both have more than 300 monthly hours of sunshine from April to June and less than 200 hours from July to September.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the student’s conclusion about weather patterns in Anchorage and Fairbanks. According to the graph, the amount of sunshine increases in both cities from April to June: in Anchorage, the number of monthly hours increases from about 250 to just under 300, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours increases from about 300 to just under 350. Also according to the graph, the amount of sunshine decreases in both cities from June to September: in Anchorage the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 300 to about 125, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 350 to about 125. Thus, the monthly hours of sunshine in both cities follow a similar pattern, increasing from April to June and then decreasing from June to September. Choice A is incorrect because, according to the graph, the monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks decrease from June to July. They don’t hold steady. In June there are slightly less than 300 hours of sunshine in Anchorage and slightly less than 350 hours in Fairbanks. Then, in July there are approximately 250 hours of sunshine in both cities. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that Anchorage and Fairbanks have less than 200 monthly hours of sunshine only in August and September. For the rest of the months represented in the graph, both cities have more than 200 monthly hours of sunshine. Choice D is incorrect because, according to the graph, Anchorage doesn’t have more than 300 monthly hours of sunshine from April to June. In addition, both cities have more than 200 hours of sunshine in July, although the amount of sunshine does decrease to less than 200 monthly hours in August and September.",

      "Archaeologist Petra Vaiglova, anthropologist Xinyi Liu, and their colleagues investigated the domestication of farm animals in China during the Bronze Age (approximately 2000 to 1000 BCE). By analyzing the chemical composition of the bones of sheep, goats, and cattle from this era, the team determined that wild plants made up the bulk of sheep’s and goats’ diets, while the cattle’s diet consisted largely of millet, a crop cultivated by humans. The team concluded that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements, whereas sheep and goats were allowed to roam farther away. Which nding, if true, would most strongly support the team’s conclusion?",
    optionA:
      "A. Analysis of the animal bones showed that the cattle’s diet also consisted of wheat, which humans widely cultivated in China during the Bronze Age.",

      "C. Cattle’s diets generally require larger amounts of food and a greater variety of nutrients than do sheep’s and goats’ diets.",
    optionD:
      "D. The diets of sheep, goats, and cattle were found to vary based on what the farmers in each Bronze Age settlement could grow.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would most strongly support the team’s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. The text explains that Vaiglova, Liu, and their colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of sheep, goat, and cattle bones from the Bronze Age in China in order to investigate the animals’ domestication, or their adaptation from a wild state to a state in which they existed in close connection with humans. According to the text, the team’s analysis showed that sheep and goats of the era fed largely on wild plants, whereas cattle fed on millet—importantly, a crop cultivated by humans. If analysis of the animal bones shows that the cattle’s diet also consisted of wheat, another crop cultivated by humans in China during the Bronze Age, the nding would support the team’s conclusion by offering additional evidence that cattle during this era fed on humangrown crops—and, by extension, that humans raised cattle relatively close to the settlements where they grew these crops, leaving goats and sheep to roam farther away in areas with wild vegetation, uncultivated by humans. Choice B is incorrect because if it were true that sheep’s and goats’ diets consisted of small portions of millet, which the text states was a crop cultivated by humans, the nding would suggest that sheep and goats were raised relatively close to human settlements, weakening the team’s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to those settlements than sheep and goats were. Choice C is incorrect because the nding that cattle generally require more food and nutrients than do sheep and goats wouldn’t support the team’s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. Nothing in the text suggests that cattle were incapable of obtaining sucient food and nutrients without access to human-grown crops. Hence, even if cattle’s diets are found to have different requirements than the diets of sheep and goats, the cattle could have met those requirements from food located far from human settlements. Choice D is incorrect because if it were true that the diets of sheep, goats, and cattle varied based on what the farmers in each Bronze Age settlement could grow, the nding would weaken the team’s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were, suggesting instead that all three types of animals were raised close enough to human settlements to feed on those settlements’ crops.",

    question:
      "Archaeologists and historians used to believe that the Maya civilization during its Classic period (roughly 250–900) lacked agricultural marketplaces. One reason for this belief was that these scholars misunderstood the ecology of the regions the Maya inhabited. Marketplaces typically emerge because different individuals or groups want to trade resources they control for resources they don’t control. Scholars seriously underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya landscape and thus assumed that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA: "A. ",
    optionB:
      "B. farming practices would have been largely the same throughout Maya lands even if the crops people produced varied signicantly.",
    optionC:
      "C. marketplaces would not have enabled Maya people to acquire many products different from those they already produce",
    optionD:
      "D. farmers would trade agricultural products only if they had already produced enough to meet their own needs.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of scholars’ understanding of Maya ecology and agricultural marketplaces. The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn’t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don’t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn’t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn’t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn’t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t say anything about trade between the Maya and people from outside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars’ mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren’t very ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn’t have marketplaces, it wouldn’t lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring resources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources throughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also produced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands, which suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied signicantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don’t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied signicantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn’t already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn’t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn’t have any need for marketplaces. The scholars’ mistaken belief has no bearing on the issue of whether farmers met their own needs before trading their products.",

      "Choice A is the best answer because it best states the main idea of the text. According to the text, jalis’ traditional role has been to maintain information about families’ histories and signicant events. The text goes on to say that although technological changes have altered jalis’ role somewhat, jalis are still valued for preserving the histories of their communities. Choice B is incorrect because the text says nothing about jalis’ views of the various tasks they perform. There is no information to support the idea that many jalis prefer teaching to other tasks. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe jalis as being sources of entertainment. Rather, jalis are presented as valued sources of knowledge. Additionally, the text gives no indication of how long jalis have been serving their communities. Choice D is incorrect because the main focus of the text is on jalis’ role and their continued value despite the effects of technology, not on what technology can now do.

      "In 2014, Amelia Quon and her team at NASA set out to build a helicopter capable of ying on Mars. Because Mars’s atmosphere is only one percent as dense as Earth’s, the air of Mars would not provide enough resistance to the rotating blades of a standard helicopter for the aircraft to stay aloft. For ve years, Quon’s team tested designs in a lab that mimicked Mars’s atmospheric conditions. The craft the team ultimately designed can y on Mars because its blades are longer and rotate faster than those of a helicopter of the same size built for Earth. According to the text, why would a helicopter built for Earth be unable to y on Mars?",
    optionA: "A. Because Mars and Earth have different atmospheric conditions",
    optionB:
      "B. Because the blades of helicopters built for Earth are too large to work on Mars",
    optionC:
      "C. Because the gravity of Mars is much weaker than the gravity of Earth",
    optionD:
      "D. Because helicopters built for Earth are too small to handle the conditions on Mars",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents an explanation about a helicopter that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Mars’s atmosphere is much less dense than Earth’s, and as a result, the air on Mars doesn’t provide the resistance required to support the blades of a helicopter built for Earth and to keep the helicopter aloft. In other words, a helicopter built for Earth can’t y on Mars because of the differences in the two planets’ atmospheres. Choice B is incorrect because instead of stating that the blades of helicopters built for Earth are too large to work on Mars, the text indicates that the helicopter built to y on Mars actually has even longer blades than a helicopter built for Earth. Choice C is incorrect because the text never addresses the role of gravity on Mars or on Earth; instead, it focuses on atmospheric conditions. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that helicopters built for Earth are too small to operate in the conditions on Mars. In fact, the text states that the size of the helicopter built to y on Mars is the same size as a helicopter built for Earth, even though it has longer blades that rotate faster.",

    optionD:
      "D. A study of dog breeds is notable for its usage of both opinion surveys and DNA sequencing.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text indicates that dog owners typically claim that some dog breeds are “more likely than others to have particular personality traits.” In other words, the text points out that a commonly held belief about dog breeds is that their personality traits are heritable. The text then states that Kathleen Morrill and colleagues undertook research about dog trait heritability and found that “behavior varies widely among dogs of the same breed.” Because Morrill and colleagues found evidence for variability rather than consistency in the behavior of dogs of the same breed, the statement that research fails to uphold a commonly held belief about dog breeds and behavior accurately reects the main idea of the text. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions that humans have long intervened in dogs’ reproduction by intentionally crossbreeding certain dogs, it doesn’t argue that such intervention is essential to the existence of dog breeds. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss the popularity of any dog breeds; breeds are mentioned as having certain traits, but the text says nothing about the popularity of these breeds or traits. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text briey mentions that Morrill and colleagues conducted a study about dog traits using both surveys and DNA sequencing, this is not the main focus of the text.

      "C. increase an individual’s capacity to form associative memories.",
    optionD: "D. decrease an individual’s capacity to create fan cells.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the mechanisms underlying associative memory. The text explains that fan cells—a type of brain cell—are necessary for the acquisition of new associative memories, and that activity among these cells requires a chemical known as dopamine, which the brain produces in response to rewards. Since the brain cells that enable the formation of associative memories require dopamine in order to function, and since the brain produces dopamine in response to rewards, it can be inferred that receiving a reward should likely help to increase an individual’s capacity to form associative memories. Choice A is incorrect because the relationship between rewards and dopamine sketched by the text is that rewards result in the production of dopamine, not that they cause an individual’s capacity to utilize dopamine to decrease. Choice B is incorrect. The text suggests that receiving a reward would produce dopamine and thereby assist with associative memory formation. However, the text never suggests that associative memory involves the capacity to recognize differences between unrelated things, indicating only that associative memory involves remembering what connects those things. Choice D is incorrect because the text never discusses how fan cells are initially created and therefore provides no evidence for a conclusion about how receiving a reward would affect their creation.",

      "D. increases the number of civilian government jobs that require some amount of military experience to perform.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of military veterans working in civilian government jobs in the United States. The text indicates that the proportion of military veterans working in civilian government jobs is considerably higher than the proportion of military veterans in the population as a whole. The text also notes that the unusually high representation of military veterans in these jobs may be a result of the organizational structures shared by civilian government entities and the military. Hence, it’s reasonable to infer that it’s the familiarity of the structures of civilian government that makes jobs there particularly attractive to military veterans. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t address what a typical relationship between military service and later career preferences would be, and there’s no indication that it’s atypical for veterans to work in civilian government jobs after they’ve left the military. On the contrary, the text suggests that many military veterans are drawn to such jobs. Choice C is incorrect because the text is focused on the high representation of military veterans in civilian government jobs and doesn’t address nonveterans or their possible interest in military service. Choice D is incorrect because the text conveys that military veterans may be particularly interested in civilian government jobs due to the familiarity of organizational structures that are already in place, but there’s no reason to think that this interest would mean that more civilian government jobs will start to require military experience.",

    question:
      "Scientists studying Mars long thought the history of its crust was relatively simple. One reason for this is that geologic and climate data collected by a spacecraft showed that the crust was largely composed of basalt, likely as a result of intense volcanic activity that brought about a magma ocean, which then cooled to form the planet’s surface. A study led by Valerie Payré focused on additional information—further analysis of data collected by the spacecraft and infrared wavelengths detected from Mars’s surface—that revealed the presence of surprisingly high concentrations of silica in certain regions on Mars. Since a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica, Payré concluded that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. the information about silica concentrations collected by the spacecraft is likely more reliable than the silica information gleaned from infrared wavelengths\ndetected from Mars’s surface.",
    optionB:
      "B. high silica concentrations on Mars likely formed from a different process than that which formed the crusts of other planets.",

      "C. having a clearer understanding of the composition of Mars’s crust and the processes by which it formed will provide more insight into how Earth’s crust forme",
    optionD:
      "D. Mars’s crust likely formed as a result of other major geological events in addition to the cooling of a magma ocean.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. Cooling magma would create basalt, but “a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica.” Since Mars’s crust does contain large amounts of silica, it is unlikely that Mars’s crust was formed exclusively by cooling magma. Therefore, there were likely other major geological events that created the high silica concentrations. Choice A is incorrect. Although the passage discusses these two methods of collecting data about Mars’s crust, it never compares their reliability, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect. The passage never mentions anything about the crusts of other planets, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it states why Wang and his team’s discovery of the Terropterus xiushanensis fossil was signicant. The text explains that up until Wang and his team’s discovery, the only fossil evidence of mixopterids came from the paleocontinent of Laurussia. Wang and his team, however, identied fossil remains of a mixopterid species from the paleocontinent Gondwana. Therefore, the team’s discovery was signicant because the fossil remains of a mixopterid species were outside of the paleocontinent Laurussia. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that Wang and his team identied fossilized remains of a mixopterid species that lived more than 400 million years ago, it doesn’t indicate that mixopterid fossils previously found by scientists dated to a more recent period than that. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that mixopterids are related to modern arachnids and horseshoe crabs, it doesn’t suggest that the fossil discovered by Wang and his team conrmed that this relationship is closer than scientists had previously thought. Choice C is incorrect because the team’s fossil established the presence of mixopterids on Gondwana, not on Laurussia. Moreover, the text only discusses the fossil in relation to the geographical distribution of mixopterids, not in relation to their evolution.",

    question:
      "Archaeologists have held that the Casarabe culture, which emerged in the southwestern Amazon basin in the rst millennium CE, was characterized by a sparse, widely distributed population and little intervention in the surrounding wilderness. Recently, however, archaeologist Heiko Prümers and colleagues conducted a study of the region using remote-sensing technology that enabled them to create three-dimensional images of the jungle-covered landscape from above, and the researchers concluded that the Casarabe people developed a form of urbanism in the Amazon basin. Which nding about the remote-sensing images, if true, would most directly support Prümers and colleagues’ conclusion?",
    optionA:
      "A. They show shapes consistent with widely separated settlements of roughly equal small size surrounded by uncultivated jungle.",

    optionD:
      "D. They show shapes consistent with monumental platforms and dense central settlements linked to smaller settlements by a system of canals and roadways.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. This nding, if true, would support the archaeologists’ conclusion. Dense central settlements linked to smaller ones would provide evidence of cities and suburbs—in other words, “a form of urbanism.” Choice A is incorrect. This nding, if true, would weaken the archaeologists’ conclusion. Widely separated, small settlements with jungle in between would support the long-held belief that the Casarabe culture “was characterized by a sparse, widely distributed population and little intervention in the surrounding wilderness.” Choice B is incorrect. This choice wouldn’t support the researchers’ conclusion. These large cities are located outside Casarabe territory, which doesn’t show evidence of Casarabe urbanism. Choice C is incorrect. This nding wouldn’t support the archaeologists’ conclusion. Scattered small farms in jungle clearings are not good evidence to support the existence of cities (“a form of urbanism”).",

What is intriguing is that bronze artifacts from China dated after the Shang dynasty do not contain this form of lead, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Shang dynasty bronze pieces are rare and therefore more valuable than those from other time periods.",

    optionD:
      "D. methods used to analyze bronze artifacts are not useful on pieces that are dated after the Shang dynasty.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. The passage tells us that Shang dynasty bronze artifacts contained "a rare form of lead," but that bronze artifacts after this time did not contain that lead. Although we don’t know where that specic type of bronze came from, we can conclude that that source was not used after the end of the Shang dynasty—otherwise, post-Shang dynasty pieces would also contain that rare form of lead. Choice A is incorrect. Despite these pieces containing "a rare form of lead," there is no direct claim in the passage that Shang dynasty bronze is itself more rare or valuable than bronze pieces from other periods. Therefore, there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although the passage mentions that the nature of the bronze in Chinese artifacts changed after the Shang dynasty, bronze was still used to create artifacts after this time. The passage in fact explicitly states "bronze artifacts from China dated after the Shang dynasty…," indicating that bronze was still used in China after the Shang dynasty. Choice D is incorrect. There’s no mention in the passage of methods used to analyze bronze artifacts, so there’s no basis for this inference.',

Some coral species appear brown in color when healthy due to the algae colonies living in their tissues. In the event of an environmental stressor, the algae can die or be expelled, causing the corals to appear white. To recover the algae, the bleached corals then begin to produce bright colors, which block intense sunlight, encouraging the light-sensitive algae to recolonize the corals. What does the text most strongly suggest about corals that produce bright colors?",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that weaken the student’s conclusion about the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards. The graph shows that the enclosure with lizards and the enclosure without lizards each began with about 85 spiders, and that the number of spiders in each enclosure fell over the 30 days of the study. The student’s claim is that the reduction in spiders in the enclosure with lizards is “entirely attributable to the presence of the lizards,” meaning that the spider population wouldn’t have declined except for the presence of the lizards. This claim is weakened, however, by the fact that the enclosure without lizards also saw a substantial reduction in the number of spiders. Since the number of spiders fell in the enclosure without lizards as well as in the enclosure with lizards, there must be some other factor than just the presence of the lizards that contributed to the reduction in the spider population. Choice A is incorrect because the fact that the two enclosures started with the same number of spiders is irrelevant to the claim that the reduction in spider population by day 30 in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Choice C is incorrect because the fact that the spider population in the enclosure with lizards fell more between days 1 and 10 than in other periods has nothing to do with the student’s claim that the reduction in spiders in that enclosure by day 30 can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Choice D is incorrect. Although it’s true that on day 30 the spider population was lower in the enclosure with lizards than in the enclosure without lizards, this fact doesn’t weaken the student’s claim that the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Indeed, the lower spider population in the enclosure with lizards suggests that the lizards are contributing to the reduction in the spider population, though the fact that the spider population also fell substantially in the other enclosure means that the lizards aren’t the only cause of the reduction.",

    optionD:
      "D. sauropods probably would not have evolved to such immense sizes if atmospheric carbon dioxide had been even slightly higher.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the relationship between atmospheric carbon dioxide and sauropod body size. The text establishes that sauropods evolved to reach enormous sizes, and it notes that some scientists have asserted that the cause of this phenomenon was increased plant production that resulted from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. The text goes on to state, however, that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels didn’t increase around the time of important periods in sauropods’ evolution of larger body sizes. If signicant periods of sauropod evolution toward larger sizes occurred without increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, that suggests that the evolution of larger sizes didn’t depend on increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe any uctuations in atmospheric carbon dioxide, so there’s no evidence in the text to support the conclusion that such uctuations had different effects on different sauropod lineages. All that the text says about atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is that there weren’t increases at particular points that correspond with key moments in sauropod evolution. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that there weren’t signicant increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide around the time of important periods in sauropods’ evolution toward larger body sizes, not that atmospheric carbon dioxide was higher when the largest sauropods lived than when sauropods rst appeared. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels didn’t increase at important periods in sauropod evolution, not that higher levels would have affected that evolution.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support the researchers’ claim about the diets of jaguars in the Brazilian Pantanal. The text notes that jaguars generally eat land-based mammals, but researchers claim that jaguars in the Pantanal can survive on a diet that includes more sh and aquatic reptiles than mammals. Finding that the remains of aquatic reptiles and sh appear more often in these jaguars’ waste than the remains of mammals do would support the researchers’ claim, since it would suggest that sh and aquatic reptiles are a more signicant part of the jaguars’ diet than mammals are. Choice B is incorrect because nding that a particular aquatic reptile exists in high numbers in the area would not support the researchers’ claim about the jaguars’ diet. The mere presence of many aquatic reptiles nearby does not mean that the jaguars eat those reptiles, let alone survive on more aquatic reptiles and sh than mammals. Choice C is incorrect. Although nding that aquatic reptiles and sh can provide nutrients that land mammals typically do not provide could help explain why some animals eat those reptiles and sh, it would not indicate whether the jaguars in particular eat those reptiles and sh and thus would not support the researchers’ claim. Choice D is incorrect because nding that when preying on mammals, jaguars prefer semiaquatic mammals, such as capybaras, would be irrelevant to the researchers’ claim that the jaguars can survive on a diet of more sh and aquatic reptiles than mammals.

    optionD:
      "D. were less likely to believe that the green plan was truly cost-effective than were participants using either the Affect or Role Modes.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the inuence of decision-making modes on consumers’ choices of different electricity plans. The Affect Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker’s social motivations, and the Calculation Mode describes choices based on minimizing nancial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, if those using a Calculation Mode disfavor the green plan, it would be due to some nancial or convenience burden the green plan imposes that the other doesn’t. The text indicates that the green plan had a lower nancial cost but was nonetheless rejected by participants using the Calculation Mode. It therefore follows that the green plan likely imposed a convenience burden that outweighed potential nancial savings for these participants. Choice A is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing nancial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, unlike the Affect or Role Modes, the Calculation Mode would almost certainly involve taking price differences into account. Choice B is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing nancial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, there is no reason to think that participants using the Calculation Mode at any point took social responsibility into account, let alone think that they discovered a disparity between their expectations and reality. Choice D is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing nancial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, the text doesn’t indicate that cost-effectiveness is a factor for participants using the Affect or Role Modes, and there is no basis to compare their beliefs in the truthfulness of the green-plan description with those of the Calculation Mode users.",

The text describes how Miranda circulated, edited, and added footnotes to “Letter to the Spanish Americans,” and it claims that the letter and its author would have “remained insignicant” if it weren’t for Miranda’s efforts. Choice A is incorrect. The text only says that Viscardo wrote the letter and that Miranda edited it: it never suggests that the original authorship of the letter is up for debate. Choice B is incorrect. This contradicts the text. The text says that Miranda edited and footnoted the letter, but it identies Viscardo as the letter’s author.

    question:
      "Geoglyphs are large-scale designs of lines or shapes created in a natural landscape. The Nazca Lines were created in the Nazca Desert in Peru by several Indigenous civilizations over a period of many centuries. Peruvian archaeologist Johny Isla specializes in these geoglyphs. At a German exhibit about the Nazca Lines, he saw an old photograph of a large geoglyph of a whalelike gure and was surprised that he didn’t recognize it. Isla returned to Peru and used a drone to search a wide area, looking for the gure from the air. This approach suggests that Isla thought that if he hadn’t already seen it, the whalelike geoglyph ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. must represent a species of whale that went extinct before there were any people in Peru.",
    optionB:
      "B. is actually located in Germany, not Peru, and isn’t part of the Nazca Lines at all.",
    optionC:
      "C. is probably in a location Isla hadn’t ever come across while on the groun",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Johny Isla and the whalelike geoglyph. The text indicates that the German exhibit about the Nazca Lines included a photograph showing a whalelike geoglyph that Isla hadn’t known about before attending the exhibit, even though Isla “specializes in” Nazca Lines geoglyphs. Given his expertise, and his surprise at being unfamiliar with the whale glyph, the text strongly suggests that Isla believed he would have noticed the glyph if he had been to its location. Thus, the text implies that the whalelike geoglyph is likely in a location Isla had not previously been to. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address either the species of whale that the geoglyph is meant to represent or its relationship to the earliest humans in the area that is now Peru. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the photograph of the whalelike geoglyph was on display at a “German exhibit,” that exhibit was specically “about the Nazca Lines,” which the text indicates are located in Peru. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that the glyphs were created “over a period of many centuries,” the text doesn’t address when in that period of time any particular glyphs were created.",

    optionB: "B. although",
    optionC: "C. although all",
    optionD: "D. although",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of A. mexicanus. According to the text, A. mexicanus, a river-dwelling sh species, has colonized caves. The sh that live in rivers and those that live in caves show no signicant genetic differences and are all capable of making the same sounds. The text indicates, however, that Hyacinthe and colleagues found that sounds that the river sh use in a particular context and for a particular purpose are used in a different context and for a different purpose by the cave sh. Additionally, the sounds made by cave sh show some differences depending on the specic cave the sh inhabit. The text goes on to state that Hyacinthe and colleagues have noted that differences in how the sh use sound to communicate could eventually become so great that they prevent sh from different locations from interbreeding. In other words, the river sh might eventually only breed with other river sh (with whom they share characteristics regarding sonic communication that they do not share with cave sh), while the cave sh might only breed with other cave sh for a similar reason. In context, this observation suggests that even though the sh are a single species right now, they could be in the process of splitting into distinct populations with different characteristics. Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text suggesting that the river sh are less reliant on sonic communication than the cave sh are. Although the text does indicate that the river sh and cave sh are genetically similar, the text describes both groups as using sonic communication and says nothing to indicate that one group depends on that communication more than the other group does. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that all members of the species can emit the same sounds but that the function and context of sounds differ depending on whether the sh live in rivers or caves, but it does not indicate that river sh produce sounds that cave sh do not or vice versa. Choice D is incorrect because it contradicts the text. The text says that there is little genetic difference between the river sh and the cave sh, not that the river sh and cave sh are so genetically distinct that they can be considered separate species.",

    question:
      "Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt have argued that experiencing awe—a sensation of reverence and wonder typically brought on by perceiving something grand or powerful—can enable us to feel more connected to others and thereby inspire us to act more altruistically. Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby. Which nding from the researchers’ study, if true, would most strongly support their claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. Participants who had been looking at the trees helped the experimenter pick up signicantly more pens than did participants who had been looking at the\nbuilding.",
    optionB:

    optionD:
      "D. Participants who had been looking at the building were signicantly more likely to notice that the experimenter had dropped the pens than were participants\nwho had been looking at the trees.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would most strongly support the researchers’ claim that they found evidence that experiencing awe can make people feel more connected to others and thus more likely to behave altruistically (with benecial and unselsh concern for others). According to the text, the researchers tested for this effect by rst having participants look at either something known to be awe-inspiring (very tall trees) or something ordinary (a plain building) and then purposely spilling pens near the participants. The nding that participants who had looked at the trees helped pick up signicantly more pens than did participants who had looked at the building would support the researchers’ claim by demonstrating that the people who had experienced awe behaved more altruistically when the experimenter needed help than the other participants did. Choice B is incorrect because a nding about helpful participants using positive words to describe the trees and the building after the experiment was over wouldn’t have any bearing on the researchers’ claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior. The text doesn’t address the use of positive words to describe things or suggest any connection between using such words and having experienced awe, so that behavior wouldn’t serve as evidence that experiencing awe played a role in promoting helpful behavior. Choice C is incorrect because a nding that participants who didn’t help the experimenter were signicantly more likely than others to report having experienced awe whether they had looked at the building or the trees would weaken the researchers’ claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior by suggesting that the opposite might be true—that experiencing awe is in fact linked to choosing not to act in a way that benets someone else. Choice D is incorrect because a nding about participants noticing that the experimenter had dropped the pens wouldn’t have any bearing on the researchers’ claim about people behaving altruistically. Being aware of a challenge or problem isn’t necessarily benecial on its own and isn’t the same as offering help, so the nding wouldn’t support the idea that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior.",

    optionD:
      "D. were higher for all three measures, indicating greater overall well-being for these participants.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement comparing the mean ratings for two different groups of participants in a study. The text explains that a research team evaluated the study’s participants using various measures in order to learn whether there might be a medical benet to telling patients they’re receiving a placebo. The table shows the team’s mean ratings for participants after 21 days for three of the measures: global improvement, symptom severity reduction, and quality of life improvement. According to the table, the mean ratings were higher for all three measures for participants aware of taking a placebo than for participants in the control group. Given that higher ratings indicate greater well-being, as the text states, the mean ratings in the table indicate greater overall well-being for participants aware of taking a placebo than for participants in the control group. Choice A is incorrect because the table doesn’t include data about individual participants; rather, it presents means, or mathematical averages, of ratings. For this reason, no conclusions can be drawn from data in the table about the extent to which well-being may have varied from participant to participant. Choice B is incorrect because according to the table, the mean ratings for participants aware of taking a placebo were higher for all three measures than for participants in the control group, not lower for two of the measures. Choice C is incorrect because it cites data from the table related to participants in the control group, not to participants aware of taking a placebo. Additionally, the mean ratings in the table for participants aware of taking a placebo are higher for all three measures than for participants in the control group. Given that higher ratings indicate greater well-being, as the text states, the ratings in the table for participants aware of taking a placebo indicate greater well-being for these participants in all three measures.",

    optionC:
      "C. Zinc levels were around 300 parts per million in the control plants but nearly 400 parts per million in the plants exposed to kanamycin.",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes data in the graph supporting Ayalew and her colleagues’ hypothesis that plants’ response to kanamycin exposure involves altering their uptake of metals. The graph compares the metal content of two groups of plants, one with kanamycin exposure and a control group without such exposure. The amount of zinc in plants without kanamycin exposure is around 400 parts per million, while the amount of zinc in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at around 300 parts per million. Similarly, the amount of iron in plants without kanamycin exposure is a little over 600 parts per million, while the amount of iron in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at a little over 200 parts per million. Thus, the graph shows that plants with kanamycin exposure have signicantly lower levels of both iron and zinc than the plants without kanamycin exposure. This is evidence supporting the hypothesis that kanamycin exposure results in plants altering their uptake of metals. Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that control plants contained higher levels of iron than zinc, not higher levels of zinc than iron; similarly, the plants exposed to kanamycin contained higher levels of zinc than iron, not higher levels of iron than zinc. Choice B is incorrect. Though the claim that both groups of plants contained more than 200 parts per million of both iron and zinc is supported by the graph, this alone does not state whether plants with kanamycin exposure have a different metal content than plants without kanamycin exposure. Choice C is incorrect. The graph shows that the zinc levels for the control plants (those without kanamycin exposure) were around 400 parts per million, not 300 parts per million, and that the zinc levels for plants with kanamycin exposure were around 300 parts per million, not 400 parts per million.",

    question:
      "Many insects are iridescent, or have colors that appear to shimmer and change when seen from different angles. Scientists have assumed that this feature helps to attract mates but could also attract predators. But biologist Karin Kjernsmo and a team had the idea that the shifting appearance of colors might actually make it harder for other animals to see iridescent insects. To test this idea, the team put beetle forewings on leaves along a forest path and then asked human participants to look for them. Some of the wings were naturally iridescent. Others were painted with a nonchanging color from the iridescent spectrum, such as purple or blue. Which nding, if true, would most directly support the team’s idea?",
    optionA:
      "A. On average, participants found most of the purple wings and blue wings and far fewer of the iridescent wings.",

    optionC:
      "C. Some participants reported that the purple wings were easier to see than the blue wings.",
    optionD:
      "D. Some participants successfully found all of the wings on the leaves.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the nding that, if true, would most strongly support the research team’s idea about the effect of iridescence, or colors that appear to shimmer and change. The text indicates that although some scientists have assumed that iridescence could attract predators, Kjernsmo’s team wondered if iridescent insects might be harder for other animals to see. The team tested this idea by asking human participants to look for both iridescent beetle wings and beetle wings that weren’t iridescent but that had been painted colors such as purple or blue. If participants located most of the purple or blue wings but far fewer of the iridescent wings, that nding would support the team’s idea since it would suggest that noniridescent wings are easier to see than iridescent wings. Choice B is incorrect because if participants located the iridescent wings more quickly than the purple or blue wings, that nding would weaken the team’s idea, not support the team’s idea, since it would suggest that the iridescent wings were easier to see than the noniridescent wings. Choice C is incorrect because nding that some participants believed that the purple wings were easier to see than the blue wings would be irrelevant to the team’s idea. The purple and blue wings were both noniridescent, so any difference in how easy those two colors were to see would have nothing to do with the idea that iridescent insects are harder to see than noniridescent insects. Choice D is incorrect because if some participants found all the wings, that wouldn’t support the team’s idea that iridescent insects may be harder to see than noniridescent insects. If anything, this nding might weaken the team’s idea since it could suggest that iridescence had no effect on how dicult the wings were to see.",

Researchers studied the introduction of an electronic transfer system in one such location and found that recipients of electronic transfers consumed a different array of foods than recipients of physical transfers of the same amount did. One potential explanation for this result is that individuals conceive of and allocate funds in physical money differently than they conceive of and allocate funds in electronic form.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. This would weaken the explanation. If the recipients of electronic money immediately withdrew it all as physical money, then both kinds of recipients ended up spending physical money on food. So there must be some other explanation why those who initially received electronic money ate different kinds of food. Choice A is incorrect. This wouldn’t weaken the explanation. If anything, it actually supports it: it demonstrates that recipients of electronic money and recipients of physical money have different spending habits. Choice C is incorrect. This wouldn’t weaken the explanation. The explanation we’re testing this choice against is about the way that people might “conceive of and allocate” physical and electronic funds differently. This choice only focuses on the timing, not what they spend the money on. Choice D is incorrect. This would have no impact on the explanation.

      "D. Blue icebergs and green icebergs contain similarly small traces of dissolved organic carbon.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would weaken the scientists’ hypothesis about icebergs that appear to be green. The text indicates that most icebergs are either mostly white or blue in color but that some icebergs in Antarctica appear to be green. The text goes on to say that the scientists hypothesized that this green color occurs when yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in ocean waters mixes with blue ice. A nding that both blue icebergs and green icebergs contain similarly small traces of dissolved organic carbon would suggest that something other than yellow-tinted organic carbon causes some icebergs’ green color, since the blue icebergs that contain yellow-tinted organic carbon remained blue instead of turning green. Choice A is incorrect because, according to the text, the scientists’ hypothesis was that blue icebergs, not white ones, change color when their ice mixes with yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon. A nding that white ice, because of its air bubbles, doesn’t change color when it’s mixed with dissolved organic carbon would therefore have no bearing on the scientists’ hypothesis. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses only on Antarctic icebergs that appear to be green. It doesn’t indicate that icebergs in locations other than Antarctica have been found to have a green hue. A nding that dissolved organic carbon has a stronger yellow color in Antarctic waters than in other places would therefore have no bearing on the scientists’ hypothesis that green color in icebergs in Antarctica is caused by yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon mixing with blue ice. Choice C is incorrect because, according to the text, the scientists’ hypothesis was that blue icebergs turn green when their ice mixes with yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in the sea around them. If that’s correct, one would expect blue icebergs and green icebergs to be located at a distance from each other since all blue icebergs in an area where the waters contain yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon would take on a green hue.

The text goes on to describe what researcher Victor Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of T. navigans, which provided additional information that fossilized skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that T. navigans had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition to the oversized head crest previously observed by paleontologists. Taken together, these characteristics would have made sustained ight dicult and upright walking comfortable, which would make T. navigans different from other pterosaurs that moved mainly through ight. Thus, Beccari and colleagues suggest that previously held speculations of paleontologists are inaccurate: that instead of moving mainly through powered ight, T. navigans likely ew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought. Choice A is incorrect because Beccari and his team determined, based on their examination of a nearly complete skeleton, that T. navigans would have found "sustained ight dicult," which would differentiate it from most other pterosaurs that moved mainly through ight. Therefore, Beccari’s team would not suggest that T. navigans ew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species with large head crests. Choice B is incorrect because the fossilized skeleton studied by Beccari and colleagues was notable for its short wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pterosaurs were thought by paleontologists to be comfortable walking. Therefore, Beccari’s team would not suggest that T. navigans had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Beccari and his team agree with the paleontologists mentioned earlier in the text that T. navigans had a large-crested head. Therefore, Beccari’s team would not suggest that T. navigans had a smaller head than researchers previously expected.',

    question:
      "Boldly mixing elements of poetry, ction, drama, philosophy, and manifesto, Puerto Rican writer Giannina Braschi creates cross-genre literature that explores themes such as immigration and independence. Her works have inspired responses from individuals across different elds and in a wide range of formats, from musical compositions and a comic book to architecture and furniture design. In an essay, a student asserts that the production of these diverse creations by others is reective of Braschi’s own approach to crafting literature. Which quotation from a scholarly review of Braschi’s work best supports the student’s claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. “Braschi is the focus of a 2020 collection of essays in which fteen scholars from seven different countries delved into the linguistic and structural patterns of\nher writings.”",
    optionB:
      "B. “Braschi’s eagerness to push boundaries and blend genres within literature invites us to consider how other art forms might also engage with literature.”",

    optionD:
      "D. “In addition to her creative literary works, Braschi has produced academic pieces analyzing writings by Miguel de Cervantes, Federico García Lorca, and other\nauthors.”",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the quotation that best supports the student’s claim about Braschi. By describing how Braschi’s blending of genres invites her audience to think about how other art forms could also engage with literature, the quotation supports the idea that the diversity of responses to Braschi’s work reects Braschi’s own approach to creating literature. Choice A is incorrect because the quotation describes scholars from different countries writing essays about Braschi’s use of language in her writings; it doesn’t address how Braschi’s creation of cross-genre literature inspires diverse types of responses, which is the claim the student makes. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation focuses on the fact that Braschi studied in several different cities, which doesn’t address the student’s claim that Braschi’s creation of cross-genre literature inspires diverse types of responses. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation lists some of the authors who Braschi has written academic works about, which is irrelevant to the student’s claim that Braschi’s creation of cross-genre literature inspires diverse types of responses.",

    optionC: "C. Australia increased steadily from 1903 to 1918.",
    optionD: "D. Turkey declined substantially from 1913 to 1918.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the example. According to the graph, fewer than 10,000 sewing machines were sold in the Philippines in both 1903 and 1908, but nearly 30,000 were sold in 1913 and around 45,000 were sold in 1918. This increase illustrates the statement in the text that demand for Singer sewing machines grew signicantly in the early twentieth century in overseas countries other than Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Choice B is incorrect because consistent sales of Singer sewing machines in New Zealand from 1903 to 1918 do not indicate that demand for the product increased but rather that demand remained relatively the same. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the data in the graph. Although sales in Australia did increase somewhat between 1903 and 1908, there was very little change between 1908 and 1913, and then sales declined between 1913 and 1918. The data for Australia, then, do not show a steady increase from 1903 to 1918. Choice D is incorrect because declining sales of Singer sewing machines in Turkey from 1913 to 1918 do not point to an increase in demand for the product but rather to a decline in demand.",

The text states that the writing system used in the Maya kingdoms had a symbol for the number zero. It goes on to say that at the time of the zero symbol’s earliest example, more than 2,000 years ago, almost no other writing systems in the world featured such a symbol.

    optionD:
      "D. “[Dr. Proudie] was certainly possessed of sucient tact to answer the purpose for which he was required without making himself troublesome.”",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. In this quotation, Dr. Proudie is described as "fondly atter[ing] himself" that he has gifts that "must be sure to recommend him to a yet higher notice." In other words, he expects his skills to push him to greater fame and success. This implies an exaggerated sense of his own abilities, which matches the claim we’re trying to support. Choice A is incorrect. This quotation doesn’t describe Proudie’s view of himself, nor does it paint him in an especially attering light. Instead, by saying his mental powers and business skill are not "proved," it implies that he is actually dim-witted and bad at business. Choice C is incorrect. This choice describes Proudie’s closeness to power and importance, but it doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself. Proudie is not describing himself or his abilities here. The narrator is. Choice D is incorrect. While this quotation offers Proudie very mild praise, it doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself or his own abilities, which is what the claim focuses on.',

    optionD:
      "D. Remnants of other goods have been found at the site in Oman that probably also reached the location through trade.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would most directly support the scholars’ claim about the board game. The text explains that the remains of a 4,000-year-old board game were found in Oman. The text then states that scholars claim this board game was played mostly by traders. If the other known examples of this board game from the same time period were discovered along routes that seem to have been used primarily by traders, this nding would directly support the scholars’ claim because it suggests that the game was largely played by traders who brought it with them for entertainment as they traveled. Choice A is incorrect because this nding would suggest only that a single trader may have possessed examples of the board game, perhaps for the purpose of trading or selling the game to residents of Oman. For this reason, the nding wouldn’t directly support the scholars’ claim that the majority of the game’s players were traders. Choice B is incorrect because this nding doesn’t mention the board game at all, referring only to similar games found at other sites, and would therefore provide no direct support for the scholars’ claim about the board game. Choice D is incorrect because this nding doesn’t mention the board game at all, referring only to the remains of other goods found at the site in Oman, and would therefore provide no direct support for the scholars’ claim about the board game.",

      'Choice C is the best answer. The text tells us that lemons—an expensive imported product—feature in Dutch paintings of the period more frequently than dairy products do. Since it’s unlikely lemons were eaten more often than dairy, this fact casts doubt on the theory that these paintings realistically depicted Dutch diets. Choice A is incorrect. In fact, the text suggests the opposite: it says that dairy products were a "major component of the Dutch diet," while lemons were an expensive import item, so we can infer that lemons were eaten much more rarely than dairy products. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention painters from other countries, so there’s no basis to make this inference. Choice D is incorrect.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively presents a quotation from There Is Confusion that illustrates the claim that the narrator portrays Joanna as admiring the quality of ambition, or the determination to achieve something, and no other qualities in other people. By describing Joanna as not being interested in people unless they have "a ‘purpose’ in life"—that is, a goal they are determined to achieve—in which case she is very interested in them, the quotation reveals that Joanna cares only about others’ ambition.

    optionD:
      "D. average lifespan of T. nylanderi worker ants in colonies without parasitic activity typically falls well below three years, the range covered by the study.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. The text describes a study examining the relationship between a species of parasitic tapeworm, A. brevis, and its host insect, the T. nylanderi ant. According to the text, researchers were surprised to nd that the tapeworm extends the life of its ant host, rather than reducing it. The text goes on to state that the infected ants end up doing less work to sustain the colony and that as a result, the uninfected ants take on the infected ants’ share of labor in addition to caring for them in their infected state. The study’s researchers also observed that the uninfected ants have shorter lifespans than expected. If the infected ants, who are doing less work in the colony, have longer lifespans, it can be inferred that the less an ant works, the longer it will live. The opposite of this statement can also be inferred: the more an ant works, the shorter its life. So, since the workload within the colony is being redistributed so that the infected ants work less while the uninfected ants work more (as they take on the neglected duties of the infected ants and also care for those ants), then it can be inferred that the lifespans of the uninfected ants are shortened because the need to compensate for reduced contributions within the colony while also caring for infected workers is burdensome to the uninfected workers. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate how A. brevis is transmitted to the ants or assert that uninfected ants are more likely to be directly exposed to A. brevis while caring for infected ants. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the relative abilities of infected and uninfected ants to escape predators: in fact, predators are not mentioned in the text at all. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not supply any information about the average lifespans of the ants in colonies without parasitic activity; the text only indicates factors that lengthen and shorten the lifespans of ants in parasitized colonies.",

In their 2016 study of a school in an Anishinaabe community in Ontario, Canada, scholars Lindsay Morcom and Stephanie Roy (who are Anishinaabe themselves) found that the model not only imparted uency in the Anishinaabe language but also enhanced students’ pride in Anishinaabe culture overall. Given these positive effects, Morcom and Roy predict that the model increases the probability that as adults, former students of the school will transmit the language to younger generations in their community. Which nding, if true, would most strongly support the researchers’ prediction?",

    optionD:
      "D. As they complete secondary and higher education, former students of the school experience no loss of uency or cultural pride.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support the researchers’ prediction about the language nest model of education. The text states that Morcom and Roy studied the effects of the language nest model of education on students at an Anishinaabe school, and they found that the model —which is used with students during pre-K or elementary school—increased students’ uency in the Anishinaabe language and pride in Anishinaabe culture. The researchers predicted that the students’ positive early experiences with the Anishinaabe language would lead them to be more likely to later share the language with younger generations. If former students maintain full uency and cultural pride after nishing secondary and higher education, it follows that they would be both able and motivated to share what they know with others; this would likely result in a higher probability of transmitting the language to younger generations, as the researchers predict. Choice A is incorrect because nding that Anishinaabe adults who didn’t attend the school feel approximately the same degree of cultural pride as those adults who did attend wouldn’t support the researchers’ prediction that former students will be more likely to share their knowledge with younger generations. This nding would identify a similarity between the groups rather than a factor that might make former students more likely than other adults to transmit the language to younger people. Choice B is incorrect because nding that new students experience increased performance in language uency and academics would suggest that the school has a positive effect on students when they attended but wouldn’t reveal anything about those students’ later actions as adults (such as their likelihood of sharing their knowledge with younger generations). Choice C is incorrect because nding that Anishinaabe adults who attended the school are equally likely to stay in the community as adults who didn’t attend the school wouldn’t support the researchers’ prediction that former students will be more likely to share their knowledge with younger generations.

    optionD:
      "D. At some sites in the study, the health of plants unrelated to eelgrass correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would weaken Foster’s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots improves the health of eelgrass meadows by boosting genetic diversity. The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgrass roots but that eelgrass meadows near Vancouver Island, where there’s a large otter population, are comparatively healthy. When Foster and her colleagues compared the Vancouver Island eelgrass meadows to those that don’t have established otter populations, the researchers found that the Vancouver Island meadows are more genetically diverse than the other meadows are. This nding led Foster to hypothesize that damage to the eelgrass roots encourages eelgrass reproduction, thereby improving genetic diversity and the health of the meadows. If, however, other meadows not included in the study are less healthy the larger the local otter population is and the longer the otters have been in residence, that would suggest that damage to the eelgrass roots, which would be expected to increase with the size and residential duration of the otter population, isn’t leading meadows to be healthier. Such a nding would therefore weaken Foster’s hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect because nding that small, recently introduced otter populations are near other eelgrass meadows in the study wouldn’t weaken Foster’s hypothesis. If otter populations were small and only recently established, they wouldn’t be expected to have caused much damage to eelgrass roots, so even if those eelgrass meadows were less healthy than the Vancouver Island meadows, that wouldn’t undermine Foster’s hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with Foster’s hypothesis since it would suggest that the greater damage caused by larger, more established otter populations is associated with healthier meadows. Choice B is incorrect because the existence of areas with otters but without eelgrass meadows wouldn’t reveal anything about whether the damage that otters cause to eelgrass roots ultimately benets eelgrass meadows. Choice D is incorrect because the health of plants other than eelgrass would have no bearing on Foster’s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots leads to greater genetic diversity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters to have a negative effect on other plants while nevertheless improving the health of eelgrass meadows by damaging eelgrass roots.",

    question:
      "Colonized by Spain in the 1600s, New Mexico is home to a dialect of Spanish that differs signicantly from dialects spoken in Spain’s other former colonies in the Americas. Most notably, the New Mexican dialect retains older features of the language that other dialects lost in later centuries. But why would it have done so? New Mexico was so distant from population centers in Spain’s other colonies that it attracted few colonists after its initial colonization. Geographical isolation in turn would have limited the exposure of New Mexican colonists to changes occurring to Spanish grammar and vocabulary elsewhere in the empire. Thus, the present-day uniqueness of the New Mexican dialect suggests the extent to which ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. a language can protect itself from being inuenced by other languages.",

      "B. the grammar and vocabulary of any given language change from one generation to the next.",
    optionC: "C. geographical isolation can inuence how a language develops.",
    optionD:
      "D. speakers of one dialect of a language can understand speakers of another dialect of that language.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it is the choice that most logically completes the text. The text mentions a dialect of Spanish spoken in New Mexico, which was colonized by Spain in the 1600s. The text then states that the New Mexican dialect differs greatly from other Spanish dialects in that it still has characteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects eventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the New Mexico colony was distant from Spain’s other colonies, making it less attractive to colonists after the initial colonization. This geographic isolation limited the colony’s exposure to other Spanish colonists who would have otherwise introduced the changes to the Spanish language that occurred in their respective colonies. It can therefore be inferred that this isolation is a reason why the New Mexican dialect still has characteristics of an older Spanish, while the Spanish dialects spoken in less isolated areas that have more interaction with speakers of other dialects would lose those characteristics over time. Thus, the most logical completion of the text is that geographical isolation can inuence how a language develops. Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses different dialects of Spanish, not different languages altogether. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on how the New Mexican dialect has stayed the same over time in some ways, not on how it has changed from one generation to the next. Choice D is incorrect because though the text discusses how the New Mexican dialect of Spanish is different from others, it does not discuss how speakers of different dialects are able to understand each other.",

One such artist was playwright María Irene Fornés.

      'Choice B is the best answer. The text tells us that the black-furred wolves are more common in areas with regular outbreaks of distemper virus and are more likely to be immune to distemper than the gray-furred wolves. This suggests that the gene variant that results in black fur may be linked to immunity to the distemper virus. Choice A is incorrect. The text never compares North American gray wolves to other wolf species—in fact, it never discusses other wolf species at all, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect.

    optionD:
      "D. excavations at Kuulo Kataa may have inadvertently damaged some artifacts dating to the fourteenth century CE.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of artifacts and Kuulo Kataa’s founding date. If it were true both that Kuulo Kataa was founded in the fourteenth century CE and that artifacts found in excavations of the settlement are from the thirteenth century CE, it would be reasonable to conclude that the artifacts weren’t created in the Kuulo Kataa settlement. That would suggest, then, that the artifacts originated somewhere else and eventually reached the settlement through trading or as people migrated. Choice A is incorrect because the existence of thirteenth-century CE artifacts recovered during excavations of a settlement founded in the fourteenth century CE isn’t logically connected to artifacts from one century being more commonly recovered than artifacts from another century. Rather than suggesting anything about how frequently artifacts from different times are found, the existence of artifacts conrmed as predating the settlement’s founding suggests that those items arrived in Kuulo Kataa during or after its establishment. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on time periods and says nothing about which region the founders of Kuulo Kataa have been thought to come from; similarly, the text doesn’t suggest anything about where the thirteenth-century CE artifacts originated other than not from Kuulo Kataa. Therefore, it isn’t logical to conclude that the mere existence of artifacts conrmed as predating the Kuulo Kataa settlement suggests that the founders of the settlement came from a particular region other than one previously assumed. Choice D is incorrect because the existence of artifacts from the thirteenth century CE at a site dated to the fourteenth century CE doesn’t imply that fourteenth-century objects were damaged during excavations. There’s nothing in the text to suggest that any objects were damaged; rather, the existence of artifacts conrmed as predating the settlement’s founding suggests that those items were brought to Kuulo Kataa during or after its establishment.",

A student conducted an experiment to illustrate this effect. The student chose three plant species for the experiment, including two that are mycorrhizal hosts (species known to benet from mycorrhizal fungi) and one nonmycorrhizal species (a species that doesn’t benet from and may even be harmed by mycorrhizal fungi). The student then grew several plants from each species both in soil containing mycorrhizal fungi and in soil that had been treated to kill mycorrhizal and other fungi.

    optionD:
      "D. corn had the highest average mass of all three species grown in soil that had been treated to kill fungi, while marigolds had the lowest.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement. The text explains that mycorrhizal hosts are plants that benet from the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in the soil and that some such plants produce more mass when grown in the presence of these fungi, while for nonmycorrhizal species the fungi either have no effect or may be harmful. The experiment included two mycorrhizal hosts (corn and marigold) and one nonmycorrhizal species (broccoli). Given the claim in the text that nonmycorrhizal species will see either no difference or a decrease in mass when exposed to mycorrhizal fungi, the student would likely have been surprised by the higher average mass for broccoli grown in the presence of the fungi than the broccoli grown in the soil treated to kill fungi. Choice B is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the corn data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host corn is more massive in the presence of the fungi likely ts with what the student expected and would therefore not be surprising. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the marigold data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host marigold is more massive in the presence of the fungi is likely what the student expected and thus would not be surprising. Choice D is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the data in the table—when grown in soil treated to kill fungi, corn had an average mass of 3.8 g while broccoli had an average mass of 7g—and because making comparisons among the plants in the no-fungi condition, by itself, does not provide a basis to compare the average mass of mycorrhizal hosts and nonmycorrhizal species grown in the presence of the fungi with those grown in the soil treated to kill fungi.",

    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the relationship between Indigenous languages and knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants. The text states that Indigenous cultures possess special knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants, which is reected in their vocabulary. The text then discusses how tribal nations are working to preserve their languages, whose daily use is declining as globally dominant languages become increasingly dominant in Indigenous communities. Given that the languages of tribal nations in what is now the United States function as repositories of knowledge about plants’ medicinal uses, it logically follows that continued use of those languages will assist with passing on knowledge about the medicinal value of plants native to the tribal nations’ lands. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that preserving Indigenous languages will increase the knowledge, not the number, of medicinal plants. Choice B is incorrect because the text is concerned with how vocabulary about the medicinal value of plants can be preserved through the continued daily use of Indigenous languages, not with how such vocabulary can be incorporated into globally dominant, non-Indigenous languages. Moreover, the text explains that the exclusive use of globally dominant languages in Indigenous communities comes at an expense to the continued daily use of those communities’ languages. Given this relationship, it is unlikely globally dominant languages would borrow Indigenous vocabulary pertaining to plants’ medicinal uses.

In 2021, a team including conservators Marie-France Lemay and Paula Zyats and materials scientist Anikó Bezur performed an extensive analysis of the map and the ink used. They found that the ink contains titanium dioxide, a compound that was rst introduced in ink manufacturing in the early 1900s.

    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur’s 2021 analysis of the Vinland Map. The text indicates that while some scholars have believed that the map was drawn in the mid-1400s, the 2021 analysis showed the presence of the compound titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the map. The text goes on to say that titanium dioxide wasn’t used to manufacture ink until the early 1900s, which means that ink containing this compound couldn’t have been available to mapmakers in the 1400s. Since mapmakers in the mid-1400s couldn’t have used ink with titanium dioxide, it follows that the Vinland Map couldn’t have been drawn by mid-1400s mapmakers. Choice A is incorrect because the 2021 nding that the ink used to draw the Vinland Map wasn’t available until the early 1900s doesn’t imply that Europeans in the mid-1400s couldn’t have known about the eastern coast of North America. While this nding suggests that the map couldn’t have been created in the mid-1400s, it doesn’t preclude the possibility that Europeans nevertheless had knowledge—and perhaps even drew other maps that are no longer in existence or are yet to be discovered by researchers—of the eastern coast of present-day North America as early as the mid-1400s. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the 2021 discovery of the presence of titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the Vinland Map caused Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur to question or reach a new conclusion about when mapmakers began using ink containing titanium compounds. Instead, the text indicates that titanium dioxide wasn’t used in ink before the early 1900s. This knowledge led the team to conclude that the map, which was drawn with ink containing titanium dioxide, couldn’t have been created in the mid-1400s. Choice D is incorrect because although the text doesn’t indicate that Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur established an exact date for the creation of the ink that was used to draw the Vinland Map, the text does say that titanium dioxide was introduced in ink manufacturing in the early 1900s. This fact provides enough information to determine that the ink that was used to draw the map was created no earlier than the early 1900s. This nding, in turn, led the team to conclude that the Vinland Map couldn’t have been drawn in the mid-1400s.",

    question:
      "External shopping cues are a type of marketing that uses obvious messaging—a display featuring a new product, for example, or a “buy one, get one free” offer—to entice consumers to make spontaneous purchases. In a study, data scientist Sam K. Hui and colleagues found that this effect can also be achieved with a less obvious cue: rearranging a store’s layout. The researchers explain that trying to nd items in new locations causes shoppers to move through more of the store, exposing them to more products and increasing the likelihood that they’ll buy an item they hadn’t planned on purchasing. Which response from a survey given to shoppers who made a purchase at a retail store best supports the researchers’ explanation?",
    optionA:
      "A. “I needed to buy some cleaning supplies, but they weren’t in their regular place. While I was looking for them, I saw this interesting notebook and decided to buy\nit, too.”",
    optionB:
      "B. “I didn’t buy everything on my shopping list today. I couldn’t nd a couple of the items in the store, even though I looked all over for them.”",
    optionC:
      "C. “The store sent me a coupon for a new brand of soup, so I came here to nd out what kinds of soup that brand offers. I decided to buy a few cans because I had\nthe coupon.”",
    optionD:
      "D. “This store is larger than one that’s closer to where I live, and it carries more products. I came here to buy some things that the other store doesn’t always have.”",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it best supports the researchers’ explanation of the results of rearranging a store’s layout. According to the text, Sam K. Hui and colleagues found that rearranging a store’s layout can encourage customers to make spontaneous purchases. The text states that the researchers explain that a change in layout causes shoppers to hunt for items’ new locations, which exposes the shoppers to more products and increases the likelihood that they’ll make an unplanned purchase. This quotation from a surveyed shopper indicates that the shopper spontaneously purchased a notebook while looking for cleaning supplies that weren’t in their usual place. The quotation therefore supports the researchers’ explanation that rearranging a store’s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t support the researchers’ explanation that rearranging a store’s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Instead of attributing an unplanned purchase to a change in layout, the quotation notes that the shopper searched for but couldn’t nd some items, and as a result the shopper purchased less, not more, than what was anticipated. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to coupons that the shopper received, not to a new store layout. Thus, the quotation doesn’t support the researchers’ explanation that rearranging a store’s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to the size and stock of the store, not to a new store layout. The shopper simply purchased products that the shopper wanted in a particular store because other stores didn’t carry those products, so the quotation doesn’t support the researchers’ explanation that rearranging a store’s layout can lead shoppers to make spontaneous purchases.",

    question:
      "It’s common for jazz musicians and fans to refer to certain songs as having “swing,” indicating that the songs provoke a strong feeling, like the impulse to tap one’s foot or dance. The exact acoustic properties that give a song swing, however, have long been thought to be undenable. To investigate swing, a team led by physicist Corentin Nelias delayed the downbeats and synchronized the offbeats in jazz piano solos and asked jazz musicians to compare the intensity of swing in each modied piece with the intensity of swing in the original piece. They found that participants were more than seven times likelier to characterize the modied songs as having swing than to characterize the original versions as having swing, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. synchronized offbeats tend to give a song swing regardless of whether downbeats are delaye",
    optionB:
      "B. the acoustic properties that give a song swing are not easy for jazz musicians to manipulate.",
    optionC:
      "C. jazz songs that feature the piano are more likely to have swing than are jazz songs that do not feature the piano.",
    optionD:
      "D. the timing of downbeats and offbeats may play a crucial role in giving a song swing.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The passage tells us that participants were “more than seven times likelier to characterize the modied songs as having swing than to characterize the original versions as having swing.” Because the modied songs had been changed by altering the timing of the downbeats and offbeats, this suggests that the timing of downbeats and offbeats may play a crucial role in giving a song swing. Choice A is incorrect. Although the passage mentions that the researchers “synchronized the offbeats” in the modied songs, they also “delayed the downbeats” in those songs. Because we can’t disentangle whether it was the synchronized offbeats, the delayed downbeats, or the combination of both that increased the song’s swing, we don’t have enough information to make this inference. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention whether or not it’s dicult for a jazz musician to give a song swing, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn’t compare jazz songs that feature piano to those that don’t, so there’s no basis for this inference.",

Many examples of the civilization’s writing system exist, but researchers haven’t yet deciphered it or identied which ancient language it represents. Nevertheless, archaeologists have found historical artifacts, such as clay gures and jewelry, that provide information about the civilization’s customs and how its communities were organized. The archaeologists’ ndings therefore suggest that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. investigating an ancient civilization is easier without knowledge of the civilization’s language.",
    optionB:
      "B. knowing an ancient civilization’s language isn’t necessary in order to learn details about the civilization.",

      "C. archaeological research should focus on nding additional artifacts rather than deciphering ancient languages.",
    optionD:
      "D. examining the civilization’s historical artifacts has resolved the debate about this civilization’s language.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Indus River valley civilization. The text establishes that archaeologists haven’t been able to interpret the Indus River valley civilization’s writing system but have nevertheless acquired information about the civilization through historical artifacts. The fact that archaeologists have been able to learn about the Indus River valley civilization’s customs and community organization from historical artifacts suggests that it isn’t necessary to understand an ancient civilization’s language to learn about the civilization. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss how easy it is to investigate ancient civilizations with or without knowledge of the civilization’s language; rather, it states that even though researchers have not yet deciphered the language of the Indus River valley civilization, they are still able to learn about it through historical artifacts. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t make any claims as to what the focus of archaeological research should be. Rather, the text discusses how archaeologists have been able to learn about an ancient civilization through historical artifacts despite not understanding the civilization’s language. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that the civilization’s language has not yet been interpreted; it makes no mention of a debate about the language.

    question:
      "To investigate the history of plate subduction—when one of Earth’s tectonic plates slides beneath another—Sarah M. Aarons and colleagues compared ancient rocks from the Acasta Gneiss Complex in Canada to modern rocks. Using isotope analysis, the researchers found that Acasta rocks dating to about 4.02 billion years ago (bya) most strongly resemble modern rocks formed in a plume setting (an area in which hot rocks from Earth’s mantle ow upward into the crust). By contrast, they found that Acasta rocks dating to about 3.75 bya and 3.6 bya have an isotope composition that is similar to that of modern rocks formed in a subduction setting. Aarons’s team therefore concluded that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA: "A. ",
    optionB:
      "B. subduction replaced mantle plume formation as the most common geological process by about 4.02 by",
    optionC:
      "C. the majority of the rocks in the Acasta Gneiss Complex formed through subduction.",
    optionD:
      "D. the rocks in the Acasta Gneiss Complex are of a more recent origin than scientists previously thought.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. Because researchers found “Acasta rocks dating to about 3.75 bya” were similar to “modern rocks formed in a subduction setting,” we can infer that subduction-like processes must have begun occurring in the Acasta Gneiss Complex by this time. Choice B is incorrect. We only know about geological processes at the Acasta Gneiss Complex, so we do not have information to make inferences about geological processes in general. Also, notice that the rocks dated to 4.02 bya were found to still be formed in a plume setting, so the transition must have happened after this time. Choice C is incorrect. There’s no mention in the passage of what proportion of the rocks within Acasta Gneiss Complex were formed through subduction, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage discusses various rocks in the Acasta Gneiss Complex that are dated to different periods of time, but nothing in the passage suggests that these dates are or were wrong.",

Using the ratio of manganese to calcium, which inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, marine scientist Rodrigo da Costa Portilho-Ramos and colleagues evaluated whether oxygenation played a role in the declines of L. pertusa. The researchers concluded that oxygenation may have been important in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast, since ______ Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement? Assessment SAT Test Reading and Writing Domain Information and Ideas Skill Command of Evidence Diculty",
    optionA: "A. ",
    optionB:
      "B. L. pertusa declined in the Alboran Sea during a period of substantial local decline in oxygenation, but L. pertusa declined near the Mauritanian coast during a\nperiod of little local change in oxygenation.",
    optionC:
      "C. oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in L. pertusa than after the decline, whereas oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was relatively\nlow both before and after the decline in L. pertus",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about Rodrigo da Costa Portilho-Ramos and colleagues’ conclusion. The graph shows the ratio of manganese to calcium in L. pertusa coral samples from the Alboran Sea and the Mauritanian coast. The graph reects time in approximate years before present: in other words, the greater the number in years noted on the graph’s horizontal axis, the farther that moment is in the past. The text indicates that the researchers tested the samples to determine whether oxygenation played a role in the decline of L. pertusa. The text goes on to note that a change in the ratio of manganese to calcium would signal an inverse, or opposite, change in oxygenation. According to the graph, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Alboran Sea increased from about 30 micromoles per mole 10,000 years ago to about 80 micromoles per mole 8,000 years ago, which means that oxygenation decreased between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago. Meanwhile, there was almost no discernible change in the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Mauritanian coast between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. According to the text, the population of L. pertusa declined signicantly around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea and around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. Thus, the increase in the ratio of manganese to calcium around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea coincides with the decline in the L. pertusa population, suggesting an association between the decrease in oxygenation and the decline in population of the coral. No such relationship is suggested around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. So, oxygenation likely played a role in the L. pertusa decline in the Alboran Sea but not in the coral’s decline near the Mauritanian coast. Choice A is incorrect because it asserts the opposite of what the graph indicates regarding oxygenation in the Alboran Sea, and it misrepresents what the graph indicates about oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast. The graph indicates that at the time of the decline in L. pertusa (approximately 9,000 years ago), the samples from the Alboran Sea contained a ratio of manganese to calcium that was increasing. According to the text, this ratio inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, so if the ratio was increasing, oxygenation was decreasing, not substantially increasing. Furthermore, the graph shows that the ratio of manganese to calcium remained relatively stable in coral samples from the Mauritanian coast during the period studied, which suggests that there was no discernible relationship between oxygenation and the coral’s population decline in that location, not that there was a substantial decrease in oxygenation corresponding to the coral’s decline. Choice C is incorrect. Although the graph suggests that the level of oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in L. pertusa than after—because the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels and this ratio was lower before the decline than after—the graph doesn’t support the claim that oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low before and after the coral’s decline there. Rather, the graph indicates that relative to coral samples from the Alboran Sea, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low, which suggests that oxygenation levels were relatively high both before and after the decline of L. pertusa. Choice D is incorrect because it states the opposite of what the graph indicates: the graph shows that throughout the period studied, the ratio of manganese to calcium was higher in coral samples from the Alboran Sea than it was in samples from near the Mauritanian coast. Since the text indicates that the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was therefore lower than, not higher than, oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied. Moreover, even if choice D did accurately represent the graph, it wouldn’t effectively complete the statement since a comparison of the ocean oxygenation levels at the two locations is not relevant to the claim that a decline in oxygenation levels was associated with the decline of L. pertusa in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast.",

    question:
      "The following text is from Milan Kundera’s 1984 novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being (translated by Michael Henry Heim in 1984). Karenin is a dog that belongs to Tomas and Tereza. Karenin was not overjoyed by the move to Switzerland [from Prague]. Karenin hated change. Dog time cannot be plotted along a straight line; it does not move on and on, from one thing to the next. It moves in a circle like the hands of a clock, which—they, too, unwilling to dash madly ahead—turn round and round the face, day in and day out following the same path. In Prague, when Tomas and Tereza bought a new chair or moved a ower pot, Karenin would look on in displeasure. It disturbed his sense of time. It was as though they were trying to dupe the hands of the clock by changing the numbers on its face. ©1984 by Milan Kundera. Translation ©1984 by Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. As a dog, Karenin possesses a sense of time that involves a strong preference for predictability and an aversion to disruption.",
    optionB:
      "B. After he’s moved to a new home, Karenin’s negative response to changes has become more pronounce",
    optionC:
      "C. Similar to Tomas and Tereza, Karenin comprehends time as circular rather than as a straightforward progression.",
    optionD:
      "D. As is the case for other dogs, Karenin’s sense of time seems to accelerate depending on the objects and places that surround him.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by stating that Tomas and Tereza’s dog Karenin felt disrupted by a recent move because of his dislike of change. The text then goes on to suggest that this is because the way a dog experiences time differs from the way humans experience time: time for a dog doesn’t move linearly, going "on and on, from one thing to the next," but instead moves circularly, "like the hands of a clock." That is, time for a dog is experienced as a cyclical pattern characterized by routine and predictability, with each day "following the same path." The text then concludes by providing examples of seemingly insignicant changes in routine that profoundly "disturbed [Karenin’s] sense of time," causing him to feel displeasure. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Karenin’s sense of time as a dog involves a strong preference for predictability and an aversion to disruption. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text emphasizes Karenin’s displeasure with the recent move to a new home, it doesn’t suggest that the move has made his negative responses more pronounced than they once were. Rather, in accounting for Karenin’s displeasure with the move to Switzerland, the text explains that Karenin generally has a negative response to any kind of change. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Karenin comprehends time similarly to how Tomas and Tereza comprehend it. On the contrary, the text strongly implies a contrast between dogs’ circular experience of time with the way humans experience time as a straightforward progression that can be "plotted on a straight line." Choice D is incorrect because the text provides no indication that a change in the places and objects surrounding Karenin causes him to feel as though time is accelerating. Although the text does use the language of "dash[ing] madly ahead" in relation to time, the phrase appears in the context of a comparison illustrating how dogs experience time: time for a dog moves just as the hands of a clock do, in a circle and "unwilling to dash madly ahead"—that is, always in a regular and predictable way.',

    question:
      "Several studies of sediment (e.g., dirt, pieces of rock, etc.) in streams have shown an inverse correlation between sediment grain size and downstream distance from the primary sediment source, suggesting that stream length has a sorting effect on sediment. In a study of sediment sampled at more than a dozen sites in Alpine streams, however, geologists Camille Litty and Fritz Schlunegger found that cross-site variations in grain size were not associated with differences in downstream distance, though they did not conclude that downstream distance is irrelevant to grain size. Rather, they concluded that sediment inux in these streams may have been suciently spatially diffuse to prevent the typical sorting effect from being observed. Which nding about the streams in the study, if true, would most directly support Litty and Schlunegger’s conclusion?",
    optionA:
      "A. The streams regularly experience portions of their banks collapsing into the water at multiple points upstream of the sampling sites.",
    optionB:
      "B. The streams contain several types of sediment that are not typically found in streams where the sorting effect has been demonstrate",
    optionC:
      "C. The streams mostly originate from the same source, but their lengths vary considerably due to the different courses they take.",
    optionD:
      "D. The streams are fed by multiple tributaries that carry signicant volumes of sediment and that enter the streams downstream of the sampling sites.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. This nding would support the conclusion. If stream banks are collapsing into the water at multiple points, then sediment is getting into the water at those various points. This supports the conclusion that the inow of sediment is very spread out. Choice B is incorrect. This nding wouldn’t support the conclusion. The conclusion is about the inux of sediment being “spatially diffuse,” meaning spread out over a large area. The type of sediment wouldn’t have an impact on the conclusions. Choice C is incorrect. This nding wouldn’t support the conclusion. It doesn’t say anything about the inux of sediment being “spatially diffuse” (spread out). Choice D is incorrect. This nding wouldn’t support the conclusion. Any sediment that enters downstream of the sampling sites wouldn’t end up in the samples, so it wouldn’t affect the ndings or the conclusion.",

The text begins by stating that María Izquierdo was an important gure in the history of twentieth-century Mexican art, but despite her importance, her work hasn’t received widespread recognition in the United States. According to the text, one reason for this is that Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera are so famous in the US that they overshadow other important Mexican artists, including Izquierdo.

      "“Valia” is a 1907 short story by Leonid Andreyev. In the story, the author emphasizes that the setting where the character Valia is reading is nearly silent: ______ Which quotation from “Valia” most effectively illustrates the claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. “The hand in which he carried his book was getting stiff with cold, but he would not ask his mother to take the book from him.”",
    optionB:
      "B. “Valia was reading a huge, very huge book, almost half as large as himself.”",
    optionC: "C. “Valia approached the window and examined the toys.”",
    optionD: "D. ”",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because this quotation most effectively illustrates the claim that the author emphasizes the near silence of the setting where the character Valia is reading. In the quotation, the author highlights the near silence of the setting by twice using the word “quiet” to describe the room. The author also calls attention to the fact that Valia is reading in a nearly silent setting by noting that the only sound to be heard is that of the pages being turned. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation suggests that Valia is in a chilly setting that causes his hand to become cold, not that he’s in a nearly silent setting. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation emphasizes the size of the book Valia is reading, not a quality of the setting where he’s reading it. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation describes Valia approaching a window and looking at toys, not reading in a quiet setting.",

      "Ratied by more than 90 countries, the Nagoya Protocol is an international agreement ensuring that Indigenous communities are compensated when their agricultural resources and knowledge of wild plants and animals are utilized by agricultural corporations. However, the protocol has shortcomings. For example, it allows corporations to insist that their agreements with communities to conduct research on the commercial uses of the communities’ resources and knowledge remain condential. Therefore, some Indigenous advocates express concern that the protocol may have the unintended effect of ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. diminishing the monetary reward that corporations might derive from their agreements with Indigenous communities.",
    optionB:
      "B. limiting the research that corporations conduct on the resources of the Indigenous communities with which they have signed agreements.",
    optionC:
      "C. preventing independent observers from determining whether the agreements guarantee equitable compensation for Indigenous communities.",
    optionD:
      "D. discouraging Indigenous communities from learning new methods for harvesting plants and animals from their corporate partners.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the argument about an unintended effect of the Nagoya Protocol. The text explains that the Nagoya Protocol is an agreement ensuring that Indigenous communities are compensated when their agricultural resources and knowledge are used by corporations. The text then states that the protocol allows corporations to keep their agreements with Indigenous communities condential, about which some Indigenous advocates express concern. Choice C, when inserted into the blank, gives a good justication for the advocates’ concern: such secrecy could mean that the public is unable to determine whether participating Indigenous communities were properly compensated under these agreements. Choice A is incorrect. The text suggests that because corporations can keep their agreements with Indigenous communities condential, Indigenous communities, not corporations, might not be compensated fairly. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the ability of corporations to keep their agreements with Indigenous communities condential would place limits on how much research corporations can undertake. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Indigenous communities aim to learn new harvesting methods from their corporate partners. Rather, the text suggests that corporations use the knowledge of Indigenous communities for their research.",

    question:
      "Political scientists who favor the traditional view of voter behavior claim that voting in an election does not change a voter’s attitude toward the candidates in that election. Focusing on each US presidential election from 1976 to 1996, Ebonya Washington and Sendhil Mullainathan tested this claim by distinguishing between subjects who had just become old enough to vote (around half of whom actually voted) and otherwise similar subjects who were slightly too young to vote (and thus none of whom voted). Washington and Mullainathan compared the attitudes of the groups of subjects toward the winning candidate two years after each election. Which nding from Washington and Mullainathan’s study, if true, would most directly weaken the claim made by people who favor the traditional view of voter behavior?",
    optionA:
      "A. Subjects’ attitudes toward the winning candidate two years after a given election were strongly predicted by subjects’ general political orientation, regardless of\nwhether subjects were old enough to vote at the time of the election.",
    optionB:
      "B. Subjects who were not old enough to vote in a given election held signicantly more positive attitudes towards the winning candidate two years later than they\nheld at the time of the election.",
    optionC:
      "C. Subjects who voted in a given election held signicantly more polarized attitudes toward the winning candidate two years later than did subjects who were not\nold enough to vote in that election.",
    optionD:
      "D. Two years after a given election, subjects who voted and subjects who were not old enough to vote were signicantly more likely to express negative attitudes\nthan positive attitudes toward the winning candidate in that election.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would weaken the claim made by people who favor the traditional view of voter behavior. According to the text, people who favor that view believe that voting in an election doesn’t change a voter’s attitude toward the candidates in that election. If Washington and Mullainathan found that two years after an election, attitudes toward the winning candidate were signicantly more polarized among subjects who had voted than among subjects who had been too young to vote, that would suggest that the act of voting did have an effect on the voters’ attitudes toward the candidates, which would undermine the claim that voting doesn’t change voters’ attitudes. Choice A is incorrect because a nding about links between subjects’ attitudes and general political orientation, regardless of age and ability to vote, wouldn’t address the presence or absence of changes in attitudes among those subjects who did actually vote. Therefore, the nding wouldn’t have any bearing on the claim that voting in an election doesn’t change a voter’s attitude toward the candidates in that election. Choice B is incorrect because a nding that positive attitudes toward a winning candidate signicantly increased in the two years after the election among subjects who had been too young to vote would involve only people who didn’t vote; therefore, the nding wouldn’t have any bearing on the claim that when people do vote, the act of voting doesn’t change their attitudes toward the candidates. Choice D is incorrect because the nding that subjects in both groups were more likely to have negative attitudes than positive attitudes toward the winning candidate two years after an election would reect all subjects’ attitudes at one particular time whether they voted or not, rather than the presence or absence of a change in voters’ attitudes after voting. Therefore, the nding would neither weaken nor strengthen the claim that voting in an election doesn’t change a voter’s attitude toward the candidates.",

    question:
      "Under normal atmospheric pressure at Earth’s surface, water molecules form a tetrahedral network stabilized by hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules. Extreme high pressure, such as can be found in deep ocean waters, destabilizes these bonds and compresses water’s structure, allowing water molecules within organisms to permeate proteins and impede crucial biological functions; yet deep-sea organisms known as piezophiles have adapted to extreme pressure. Studies have found a positive correlation between the depths that various piezophiles inhabit and concentrations of a compound called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in their muscle tissues, which has led a team of researchers to hypothesize that TMAO reduces water’s compressibility. Which nding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ hypothesis?",
    optionA:
      "A. Water molecules are found to be impervious to TMAO even when the water molecules’ tetrahedral conguration has been distorted by high pressure.",
    optionB:
      "B. Examination of TMAO’s molecular structure shows that TMAO molecules retain their shape even as pressure increases.",
    optionC:
      "C. A positive correlation is found between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water’s molecular structure compresses as pressure increases.",
    optionD:
      "D. Analysis of water’s molecular structure under high pressure reveals that hydrogen bonds are more stable when TMAO is present than when it is not.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support the researchers’ hypothesis that TMAO reduces water’s compressibility. The text explains that at great depths in the ocean, extreme pressure compresses the molecular structure of water by destabilizing the hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules, thereby allowing water to penetrate proteins and harm the associated organisms. However, deep-sea organisms called piezophiles have adapted to live at these depths and previous studies show a positive correlation between the depth at which a piezophile species lives and the species’ level of the compound TMAO. Because this hypothesis links TMAO levels with reduced compressibility of water’s tetrahedral molecular structure, a nding that TMAO helps maintain the hydrogen bonds between water molecules under high pressure would strongly support that hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect. Although the researchers’ hypothesis suggests a relationship between TMAO and water molecules’ tetrahedral molecular structure, that relationship involves TMAO helping maintain water’s tetrahedral molecular structure under high pressure; as presented in the text, the hypothesis doesn’t contend that water molecules are impervious to, or incapable of being penetrated by, TMAO. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses how the molecular structure of water, not TMAO, is compressed under extreme pressure and never addresses how TMAO might be affected by such pressure. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis holds that water under extreme pressure is more resistant, not less, to being compressed when TMAO concentrations are higher. Moreover, the positive correlation mentioned in the text is between TMAO concentrations and the depths at which piezophiles live, not between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water’s molecular structure compresses as pressure increases.",

      "Researchers hypothesized that a decline in the population of dusky sharks near the mid-Atlantic coast of North America led to a decline in the population of eastern oysters in the region. Dusky sharks do not typically consume eastern oysters but do consume cownose rays, which are the main predators of the oysters. Which nding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ hypothesis?",
    optionA:
      "A. Declines in the regional abundance of dusky sharks’ prey other than cownose rays are associated with regional declines in dusky shark abundance.",
    optionB:
      "B. Eastern oyster abundance tends to be greater in areas with both dusky sharks and cownose rays than in areas with only dusky sharks.",
    optionC:
      "C. Consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays in the region substantially increased before the regional decline in dusky shark abundance began.",
    optionD:
      "D. Cownose rays have increased in regional abundance as dusky sharks have decreased in regional abundance.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ hypothesis about the connection between the dusky shark population decline and the eastern oyster population decline. The text indicates that although dusky sharks don’t usually eat eastern oysters, they do consume cownose rays, which are the main predators of eastern oysters. An increase in the abundance of cownose rays in the region in response to a decline in the abundance of dusky sharks would directly support the researchers’ hypothesis: a higher number of cownose rays would consume more eastern oysters, driving down the oyster population. Choice A is incorrect because a nding that there’s an association between a decline in the regional abundance of some of dusky sharks’ prey and the regional abundance of dusky sharks wouldn’t directly support the researchers’ hypothesis that a decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. Although such a nding might help explain why shark abundance has declined, it would reveal nothing about whether the shark decline is related to the oyster decline. Choice B is incorrect because a nding that eastern oyster abundance tends to be greater when dusky sharks and cownose rays are present than when only dusky sharks are present wouldn’t support the researchers’ hypothesis that a decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. The text indicates that the sharks prey on the rays, which are the main predators of the oysters; if oyster abundance is found to be greater when rays are present than when rays are absent, that would suggest that rays aren’t keeping oyster abundance down, and thus that a decline in rays’ predators, which would be expected to lead to an increase in the abundance of rays, wouldn’t bring about a decline in oyster abundance as the researchers hypothesize. Choice C is incorrect because a nding that consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays increased substantially before dusky sharks declined in regional abundance wouldn’t support the researchers’ hypothesis that the decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. Such a nding would suggest that some factor other than shark abundance led to an increase in rays’ consumption of oysters and thus to a decrease in oyster abundance, thereby weakening the researchers’ hypothesis.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the example of the high cost and low popularity of world’s fairs. The text presents Chow’s argument that the United States hasn’t hosted a world’s fair since 1984 because people think these exhibitions are overly expensive and insuciently popular. The text then cites the 1984 World’s Fair as an example, noting that it cost $350 million.

      "D. says of himself, “I will do such things— / What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be / The terrors of the earth!”",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from King Lear to illustrate the claim that King Lear expresses regret for his actions. In the quotation, Lear describes striking himself on the head—the same act he’s engaged in as he speaks, and one that suggests he’s deeply upset with himself. Referring to himself in the second person (with “thy”), the character exclaims “Beat at this gate that let thy folly in / And thy dear judgement out!” Lear refers metaphorically to his own mind as a gate that has allowed folly, or poor judgement, to enter and good judgement to escape. This suggests that Lear regrets his attempts to test his three daughters’ devotion to him, regarding those attempts as examples of the folly that has entered the gate of his mind. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t express King Lear’s sense of regret over his own actions; instead, it expresses his belief that the harm that others have done to him (or the extent to which they have “sinned against” him) outweighs whatever harm he himself has caused by “sinning.” Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t express King Lear’s sense of regret over his own actions; instead, it expresses his thoughts about an approaching storm (“this tempest”), which he believes “will not give [him] leave to ponder,” or time to consider, the harm that he will continue to experience (“things” that “would hurt [him] more”). Choice D is incorrect because this quotation expresses King Lear’s vow to commit terrible actions (or “things” that “shall be / The terrors of the earth”) in the future, not his regret over actions that he’s already taken.",

      "In the twentieth century, ethnographers made a concerted effort to collect Mexican American folklore, but they did not always agree about that folklore’s origins. Scholars such as Aurelio Espinosa claimed that Mexican American folklore derived largely from the folklore of Spain, which ruled Mexico and what is now the southwestern United States from the sixteenth to early nineteenth centuries. Scholars such as Américo Paredes, by contrast, argued that while some Spanish inuence is undeniable, Mexican American folklore is mainly the product of the ongoing interactions of various cultures in Mexico and the United States. Which nding, if true, would most directly support Paredes’s argument?",
    optionA:
      "A. The folklore that the ethnographers collected included several songs written in the form of a décima, a type of poem originating in late sixteenth-century Spain.",

    optionD:
      "D. Most of the folklore that the ethnographers collected consisted of corridos—ballads about history and social life—of a clearly recent origin.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support Paredes’s argument that Mexican-American folklore is mostly the result of cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than an adaptation of Spanish folklore. The text describes a disagreement among scholars about whether Mexican-American folklore mostly derived from the folklore of Spain or originated in Mexico and the United States as cultures there have interacted. The latter view is the argument that Paredes puts forward. If Mexican-American folklore collected in the twentieth century mostly consists of ballads about history and social life that originated recently, then that would support Paredes’s argument, since it would suggest that the folklore mostly arose after Spanish rule ended in the early nineteenth century and that the folklore reects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than traditions from Spain. Choice A is incorrect because the inclusion of songs inuenced by sixteenth-century Spanish poetry among Mexican-American folklore collected in the twentieth century would not support Paredes’s view that the folklore was the result of cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than an offshoot of Spanish folklore. If anything, the presence of such songs among the folklore collected in the twentieth century would weaken Paredes’s argument, since it would reect the inuence of Spanish culture on the folklore. Choice B is incorrect because the mere presence of similarities in Mexican-American folklore across regions would not be sucient to draw a conclusion about where the folklore originated, let alone to support Paredes’s argument that the folklore reects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States. In fact, since Paredes argued that Mexican-American folklore is the product of various cultures interacting in Mexico and the United States, he would likely expect there to be regional variations in folklore as different cultures have interacted in different places. Choice C is incorrect because scholars’ previous ignorance of the folklore would have no bearing on Paredes’s argument that Mexican-American folklore mostly reects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States. The folklore’s origins are independent of scholars’ knowledge of the folklore.",

Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.” What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?",

      "C. will emerge in a greater number of mammal species because it may serve a necessary function in the immune system.",
    optionD:
      "D. produced higher concentrations of lymphoid tissue in mammals in the past than it does currently.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Smith and colleagues’ investigation of the evolution and biological role of the appendix. The text indicates that the team found several instances of the appendix emerging and not disappearing in the lineages of various mammal species the team examined. Furthermore, the text states that species that possess an appendix also tend to have relatively high amounts of lymphoid tissue—a type of tissue that supports immune system function. Taken together, these details strongly support the hypothesis that the appendix has persisted in some species because it has a function that contributes to effective immune responses in those species. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address any nonmammalian species. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t make predictions about the evolutionary future of the species Smith and colleagues examined, and although the implication of the text is that the appendix likely does serve a function for the immune system, nothing in the text indicates that the appendix will become more widespread in the future. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does suggest an association between having an appendix and relatively high concentrations of lymphoid tissue, it doesn’t claim that the appendix causes the tissue to grow, nor does it address the relative production of the tissue at different periods of time.",

    question:
      "Since its completion in 2014, Bosco Verticale (Vertical Forest)—a pair of residential towers in Milan, Italy, covered by vegetation—has become a striking symbol of environmental sustainability in architecture. Stefano Boeri intended his design, which features balconies that are home to hundreds of trees, to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity. However, the concept has faced skepticism: critics note that although the trees used in Bosco Verticale were specically cultivated for the project, it’s too early to tell if they can thrive in this unusual setting. According to the text, why are some critics skeptical of the concept behind Bosco Verticale?",
    optionA:
      "A. Some essential aspects of Bosco Verticale’s design are dicult to adapt to locations other than Milan.",
    optionB:
      "B. The plant life on Bosco Verticale ended up being less varied than Boeri had envisioned it would be.",
    optionC:
      "C. The construction of Bosco Verticale was no less environmentally damaging than the construction of more conventional buildings is.",
    optionD:
      "D. It is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support the plant life included in its design.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about critics’ skepticism of Bosco Verticale that is supported by the text. The text states that Boeri’s design for Bosco Verticale features hundreds of trees on balconies and is intended to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity. But the text goes on to state that some critics believe that it is too early to determine if the trees planted on Bosco Verticale can thrive there. Therefore, according to the text, critics are skeptical of the concept behind Bosco Verticale because it is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support the plant life included in its design. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri’s goals was for Bosco Verticale to serve as a model for promoting biodiversity in architecture, which suggests that Boeri would likely support the idea of reproducing the same concept in other locations, the text does not discuss whether it is feasible to adapt the design to locations other than Milan. Instead, the text describes critics’ concerns that the plant life that currently exists on Bosco Verticale might not thrive in its current setting. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri’s goals in creating Bosco Verticale was to promote biodiversity, which implies a goal of including varied plant life in the design, it does not mention whether the hundreds of trees that were planted on its balconies failed to meet this goal. Rather, the text states that some critics are concerned that the trees on Bosco Verticale’s balconies may not thrive in this setting. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not mention how Bosco Verticale was constructed, let alone how environmentally destructive its construction may have been relative to the construction of more conventional buildings.",

One limitation of the cells, however, has to do with their electron transport layer (ETL), through which absorbed electrons must pass. Often the ETL is applied through a process called spin coating, but such ETLs are fairly inecient at converting input power to output power. André Taylor and colleagues tested a novel spray coating method for applying the ETL. The team produced ETLs of various thicknesses and concluded that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion eciency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells. Which choice best describes data from the graph that support Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion?",
    optionA:
      "A. Both the ETL applied through spin coating and the ETL applied through spray coating showed a power conversion eciency greater than 10% at their lowest\nperforming thickness.",
    optionB:
      "B. The lowest performing ETL applied through spray coating had a higher power conversion eciency than the highest performing ETL applied through spin\ncoating.",
    optionC:

    optionD:
      "D. There was a substantial difference in power conversion eciency between the lowest and highest performing ETLs applied through spray coating.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion eciency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells. The text explains that perovskite solar cells’ eciency at converting light into electricity is diminished by their electron transport layer (ETL), which is applied through spin coating, but that Taylor’s team devised a new spray coating method for applying the ETL that improves its power conversion eciency. The graph displays data on the power conversion eciency of solar cells in tests conducted by Taylor’s team, with bars for both the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs in two data categories: spray coating and spin coating. According to the graph, the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion eciency of between 14% and 16%, while the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating had a power conversion eciency of less than 14%. These data conrm that ETLs applied through novel spray coating are more ecient than those applied though traditional spin coating. Thus, the data support Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion about spray coating’s potential value. Choice A is incorrect. Although this claim correctly describes the data in the graph by stating that both the lowest-performing ETL applied through spin coating and the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion eciency greater than 10%, this relationship in the data doesn’t support or relate to Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion that spray coating promises greater eciency for solar cells than traditional spin coating does. Choice C is incorrect. This claim does address the greater power conversion eciency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating, compared with the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating. However, it also incorrectly cites the value for the eciency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating as approximately 13%, instead of a value between 14% and 16%, and the value for the eciency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating as approximately 11%, instead of a value between 12% and 14%, as shown in the graph. Choice D is incorrect because Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion is based on the difference in the power conversion eciency of ETLs applied through spray coating and that of ETLs applied through spin coating, not on the difference between the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs applied through just spray coating.",

    question:
      "Laura Mulvey has theorized that in narrative lm, shots issuing from a protagonist’s point of view compel viewers to identify with the character. Such identication is heightened by “invisible editing,” or editing so inconspicuous that it renders cuts between shots almost unnoticeable. Conversely, Mulvey proposes that conspicuous editing or an absence of point-of-view shots would induce a more critical stance toward a protagonist. Consider, for example, the attic scene in Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds, a conspicuously edited sequence of tens of shots, few of which correspond to the protagonist’s point of view. According to Mulvey’s logic, this scene should affect viewers by ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. obscuring their awareness of the high degree of artice involved in constructing the montage.",
    optionB:
      "B. lessening their identication with the protagonist, if not alienating them from the character altogether.",
    optionC:
      "C. compelling them to identify with the lm’s director, whose proxy is the camera, and not with the protagonist.",
    optionD:
      "D. diverting their attention away from the lm’s content and toward its stylistic attributes.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. We’re told that point-of-view shots and “invisible editing” make audiences identify with a character. We’re also told that obvious editing and a lack of point-of-view shots have the opposite effect. Since the sequence in The Birds falls into this second category, it should have the effect of reducing the audience’s connection with the protagonist. Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention viewers’ awareness of artice (i.e., camera trickery) in lms, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the director at all, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage doesn’t discuss whether a lm’s “stylistic attributes” may distract viewers from the lm’s story, so there’s no basis for this inference.",

      "“Lines Written in Early Spring” is a 1798 poem by William Wordsworth. In the poem, the speaker describes having contradictory feelings while experiencing the sights and sounds of a spring day: ______ Which quotation from “Lines Written in Early Spring” most effectively illustrates the claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. “Through primrose-tufts, in that sweet bower, / The periwinkle trail’d its wreathes; / And ’tis my faith that every ower / Enjoys the air it breathes.”",
    optionB:
      "B. “The budding twigs spread out their fan, / To catch the breezy air; / And I must think, do all I can, / That there was pleasure there.”",
    optionC:
      "C. “The birds around me hopp’d and play’d: / Their thoughts I cannot measure, / But the least motion which they made, / It seem’d a thrill of pleasure.”",
    optionD: "D. ”",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker has contradictory feelings while experiencing the sights and sounds of spring. This quotation indicates that the speaker is reclined in a grove listening to a thousand sounds. Even though the speaker is in a "sweet mood" and thinking "pleasant thoughts," those pleasant thoughts also bring to mind "sad thoughts." In other words, these lines illustrate the claim that the speaker is having contradictory thoughts while immersed in the sights and sounds of spring. Choice A is incorrect. Although this quotation refers to several owers (primroses and periwinkles) and indicates that the speaker is in a "bower," or shady spot among the trees—details which suggest that the speaker is experiencing the sights of spring—it doesn’t suggest that the speaker is having contradictory feelings, only that the speaker believes that the owers are experiencing enjoyment. Choice B is incorrect. Although this quotation focuses on the sights of spring—namely, new leaves on nearby trees appear to be opening up ("The budding twigs spread out their fan") to feel the breeze—the quotation doesn’t suggest that the speaker feels conicted about this: the statement "And I must think, do all I can" suggests the speaker’s determination to attribute feelings of pleasure to the trees, not that the speaker is experiencing contradictory feelings. Choice C is incorrect. Although this quotation indicates that the speaker isn’t certain what the birds are thinking ("Their thoughts I cannot measure"), there’s nothing to suggest that the speaker is experiencing contradictory feelings. Rather, the quotation suggests that although the speaker is uncertain about the birds’ feelings, the speaker believes that the birds’ movements likely suggest their pleasure.',

      "Even with the widespread adoption of personal computers, many authors still choose to write and revise their novels by hand and only then transcribe the nal version on a computer. It may be tempting to speculate about how a novel written this way would be affected if it had been exclusively typed instead, but each novel is a unique entity resulting from a specic set of circumstances. Therefore, ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. in order to increase their eciency, authors who currently write their novels largely by hand should instead work only on a computer.",
    optionB:
      "B. authors who do most of their drafting and revising by hand likely have more success than those who work entirely on a computer.",
    optionC:
      "C. novels written by hand take less time to produce, on average, than novels written on a computer do.",
    optionD:
      "D. there is no way to reasonably evaluate how a work would be different if it had been written by other means.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the means authors use to write and revise their novels. After stating that many authors still choose to draft novels by hand even though computers are now widely used, the text acknowledges the speculation that the opposite choice—using only a computer—would have had an effect on such novels. However, the text then points out that every novel is the singular result of a combination of the particular conditions surrounding its creation. This suggests that it isn’t possible to determine the effect of any single condition (such as the means of writing) on its own; thus, there would be no way to reasonably evaluate how a novel would have turned out differently if it had been written by other means. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that it’s more ecient to write a novel on a computer than to write it by hand; it doesn’t address eciency at all. Therefore, it isn’t logical to conclude that authors who currently choose to write novels largely by hand should instead work only on a computer to increase their eciency. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest anything about how successful authors are, regardless of the means by which they choose to write; therefore, it isn’t logical to conclude that authors who write largely by hand are likely to be more successful than those who work only on a computer. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the time it takes to produce a novel, regardless of the means by which it’s written; therefore, it isn’t logical to conclude that novels written by hand take less time on average to produce than those written on a computer do.",

      "Ablation Rates for Three Elements in Cosmic Dust, by Dust Source Element SPC AST HTC OCC iron 20% 28% 90% 98% potassium 44% 74% 97% 100% sodium 45% 75% 99% 100% Earth’s atmosphere is bombarded by cosmic dust originating from several sources: short-period comets (SPCs), particles from the asteroid belt (ASTs), Halley-type comets (HTCs), and Oort cloud comets (OCCs). Some of the dust’s material vaporizes in the atmosphere in a process called ablation, and the faster the particles move, the higher the rate of ablation. Astrophysicist Juan Diego Carrillo-Sánchez led a team that calculated average ablation rates for elements in the dust (such as iron and potassium) and showed that material in slower-moving SPC or AST dust has a lower rate than the same material in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. For example, whereas the average ablation rate for iron from AST dust is 28%, the average rate for ______ Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the example?",
    optionA: "A. iron from SPC dust is 20%.",
    optionB: "B. sodium from OCC dust is 100%.",
    optionC: "C. iron from HTC dust is 90%.",
    optionD: "D. sodium from AST dust is 75%.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively completes the example regarding the ablation rate of iron. The table shows the ablation rates for three elements—iron, potassium, and sodium—found in cosmic dust that comes from one of four sources. The text says that the ablation rate for a given element in slower-moving SPC and AST dust was lower than the ablation rate for that same element in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. The text then presents the rst part of an example of this pattern, describing an ablation rate of 28% for iron in AST dust. The information that iron from HTC dust had an ablation rate of 90% is therefore the most effective way to complete this example—the comparison of a relatively low ablation rate for iron in slower-moving AST dust with a relatively high ablation rate for iron in faster-moving HTC dust illustrates the tendency of ablation rates for a given element to be lower in slower-moving dust than in faster-moving dust. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that SPC dust, like AST dust, moves relatively slowly; a comparison of the ablation rates of iron from two slowermoving dust sources could not be an example of the difference between ablation rates in slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, which is the pattern that the example is supposed to illustrate. Choice B is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the rst part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Choice D is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the rst part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Additionally, any ablation rate from AST dust would be ineffective in this example since AST dust is referenced in the rst part of the example and thus additional data focused on AST dust would not illustrate a variation across dust types.",

These elements include leather fringe and jingles, the metal cones that cover the dresses worn in the jingle dance, a women’s dance of the Ojibwe people. Thus, Gibson combines an object commonly associated with masculinity (a punching bag) with art forms traditionally practiced by women in most Native communities (beadwork and dressmaking). In this way, he rejects the division of male and female gender roles. Which choice best describes Gibson’s approach to art, as presented in the text?",

    optionD:
      "D. He rejects expectations about color and pattern when incorporating beadwork.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes Gibson’s approach to art. As the text explains, Gibson, who is Cherokee and Choctaw, transforms punching bags into art pieces by applying (or attaching) to them beadwork and elements of Native dressmaking, including leather fringe and the jingles of the jingle dress. The text goes on to say that in most Native communities, the art forms of beadwork and dressmaking are traditionally practiced by women. Therefore, Gibson’s approach to art consists of creating original works by drawing from traditional Native art forms. Choice B is incorrect. Because Gibson incorporates Native art forms into his own original artwork, it can be inferred that he has been inuenced by other Native artists, but the text never suggests that non-Native artists have inuenced him. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Gibson designs dresses inuenced by boxing but instead that he turns punching bags, which are used in boxing, into works of art by applying elements of Native dressmaking to them. Choice D is incorrect.

The table shows the number of cars produced annually and number of companies producing cars in the United States between 1910 and 1925 in increments of ve years. According to the table, the number of cars produced consistently increased from one increment to the next, going from 123,990 cars in 1910 to 3,185,881 cars in 1925. At the same time, the table shows that the number of companies producing cars consistently decreased, going from 320 companies in 1910 to only 80 companies in 1925. Thus, the table shows that the number of cars produced increased from 1910 to 1925, even as the number of companies producing cars decreased. Choice B is incorrect. The table shows that the number of cars produced in the US increased, going from 123,990 in 1910 to 3,185,881 in 1925, instead of remaining unchanged, and the table also shows that the number of companies producing cars decreased from 320 to 80 instead of remaining unchanged. Choice C is incorrect because the table indicates that the number of cars produced consistently increased from 1910 to 1925, going from 123,990 cars to 3,185,881 cars, instead of decreasing; moreover, the table shows that the number of companies producing cars from 1910 to 1925 declined from 320 to 80 instead of remaining unchanged. Choice D is incorrect because the table indicates that the number of companies producing cars consistently decreased from 1910 to 1925, going from 320 companies to only 80 companies.",

      "Percentage of Available Eggs Eaten by Cane Toad Tadpoles Amphibian species (common name) Percentage of eggs eaten Native to Australia Produces bufadienolide Little red tree frog 1% yes no Cane toad 90% no yes Short-footed frog 7% yes no Striped burrowing frog 10% yes no Dainty green tree frog 1% yes no Native to Latin America, the cane toad was introduced to Australia in the 1930s. In recent decades, tadpoles in the Australian population have been shown to consume eggs of their own species. A 2022 study showed that when presented with cane toad eggs as well as eggs of native Australian amphibians, cane toad tadpoles disproportionately consumed eggs of their own species. This behavior results from their attraction to bufadienolide, a chemical produced by the eggs of cane toads but not by the eggs of native amphibians. However, using data from this study, a student wishes to argue that the presence of bufadienolide doesn’t entirely explain the cane toad tadpoles’ preference for certain eggs over others. Which choice best describes data from the table that support the student’s argument?",
    optionA:
      "A. The tadpoles consumed a higher percentage of the striped burrowing frog eggs than they did of the eggs of the dainty green tree frog.",
    optionB:
      "B. The tadpoles left a certain percentage of the eggs of each of the ve species unharmed, thus ultimately allowing them to hatch.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the student’s argument about the role of bufadienolide in the egg preferences of cane toad tadpoles. For each of ve amphibian species included in the 2022 study, the table gives the percentage of available eggs that the cane toad tadpoles ate. According to the table, the tadpoles ate 10% of striped burrowing frog eggs and 1% of dainty green tree frog eggs, which suggests a preference for striped burrowing frog eggs over dainty green tree frog eggs. The table also indicates that neither of these species’ eggs produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data suggest that something other than the presence or absence of bufadienolide is needed to adequately explain the tadpoles’ egg preferences. Choice B is incorrect. Although the table shows that for each of the ve amphibian species, the cane toad tadpoles ate less than 100% of that species’ eggs, which demonstrates that the tadpoles did indeed leave some eggs for each species unharmed, this fact alone is irrelevant to the tadpoles’ preferences for some species’ eggs over other species’ eggs. Choice C is incorrect. Although the table indicates that the cane toad tadpoles ate 90% of the cane toad eggs and 7% of the shortfooted frog eggs, which suggests that they prefer cane toad eggs over short-footed frog eggs, the table also indicates that cane toad eggs produce bufadienolide, whereas short-footed frog eggs do not. Therefore, these data are not sucient to exclude that bufadienolide alone could explain the tadpoles’ preference for some species’ eggs over other species’ eggs. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that for both dainty green tree frog eggs and little red tree frog eggs, the cane toad tadpoles ate 1% of those species’ eggs, it also indicates that neither produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data alone don’t indicate bufadienolide’s role in the tadpoles’ egg preferences.",

    question:
      "In vertical inheritance, parents pass genes to their offspring, but in horizontal transfer (HT), one species, often bacteria, passes genetic material to an unrelated species. In a 2022 study, herpetologist Atsushi Kurabayashi and his team investigated HT in multicellular organisms—namely, snakes and frogs in Madagascar. The team detected BovB—a gene transmitted vertically in snakes—in many frog species. The apparent direction of gene transfer seems counterintuitive because frogs usually don’t survive encounters with snakes and so wouldn’t be able to transmit the newly acquired gene to offspring, but the team concluded that BovB is indeed transmitted from snakes to frogs, either directly or indirectly, via HT. Which nding, if true, would most directly support the team’s conclusion?",
    optionA: "A. BovB can be transmitted across frog species through HT.",
    optionB: "B. ",
    optionC:
      "C. BovB cannot be reliably transmitted from a snake species to bacteria that are usually encountered by frog species.",
    optionD:
      "D. Frog species with BovB show few discernible advantages as compared with frog species that do not carry Bov",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. If there are parasites that feed on both snakes and frogs, they could carry BovB from snakes to frogs. HT could occur “indirectly” through those encounters, which frogs are more likely to survive than snake encounters. Choice A is incorrect. The team’s conclusion specically argues that BovB is transmitted from snakes to frogs via HT, and this choice doesn’t mention snakes. Choice C is incorrect. The team argues that BovB is transmitted from snakes to frogs via HT, and this answer choice discusses a scenario in which the gene is not transmitted. Choice D is incorrect. Whether or not frog species with BovB are advantaged isn’t relevant to the team’s conclusion about how the gene is transmitted.",

    optionD:
      "D. the costs of writing, editing, and designing a book were less affected by the technologies used than were the costs of manufacturing and distributing a book.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of how digital technologies affected the process of book creation. The text explains that in the late 20th and early 21st centuries digital technologies lowered book production costs most signicantly in manufacturing and distribution. The text goes on to point out that authoring, editing, and book design are distinct steps in the process that occur before manufacturing and distribution. Because the savings connected to digital technologies have been most signicant in manufacturing and distribution, it’s reasonable to infer that those technologies had less of an effect on writing, editing, and designing books. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on lowered book production costs that occur after authoring has taken place; there’s no indication in the text whether digital technologies made writing and publishing lengthy books easier. Choice B is incorrect. Although it’s logical to conclude that customers would expect the cost of books to decline if production costs have declined, the text doesn’t address customer expectations for the cost of books or any other consumer goods. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses broadly on how digital technologies have affected the cost of the publishing process; it doesn’t address the kinds of books being published or how many copies are printed.",

    question:
      "A subject of much speculation, distinctive sets of parallel ridges mark the icy crust of Europa, Jupiter’s smallest moon. Researchers now claim that the ridges’ formation mechanism mirrors that of a strikingly similar pair on Greenland’s ice sheet. There, surface water seeped through ssures in the sheet and formed a water pocket that subsequently disrupted the overlying ice, forcing fragments of it upward and outward into peaks, as the pocket froze and expanded. Although Europa lacks liquid surface water, the same process could be driven by the moon’s subsurface ocean. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Researchers think that the ridges on Europa and the ridges in Greenland may have been formed by the same process even though Europa, unlike Greenland,\ndoesn’t have liquid water on its surface.",
    optionB:
      "B. The primary difference between the ridges on Europa and the ridges in Greenland is that unlike the Europa ridges, the Greenland ridges are parallel.",

    optionD:
      "D. Researchers don’t understand why Europa is marked by so many sets of ridges when the moon doesn’t have any liquid water on its surface that could have\ncollected and expanded under the icy crust.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it accurately states the main idea of the text. The text focuses on formations of parallel ice ridges on Jupiter’s moon Europa that are said to be formed by the same mechanism that formed a parallel set of ridges on Greenland’s ice sheet. The text indicates that in Greenland, water on the surface seeps to the lower portion of the ice sheet, resulting in uplift that creates the ridges, and it states that although Europa lacks liquid water on its surface, the same process could be driven by an ocean below Europa’s surface. In other words, the main idea of the text is that parallel ridges in the ice on Europa and Greenland are likely caused by similar processes even though in Greenland the process begins with liquid water on the surface while Europa lacks liquid water on the surface. Choice B is incorrect because the text states outright that the ridges on Europa are parallel and furthermore refers to Greenland’s ridges as "strikingly similar" to those on Europa. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of when any of the ice ridges formed, either separately or relative to one another. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not indicate any uncertainty about the reason for the ice ridges on Europa and, in fact, clearly states that researchers now claim to know the mechanism that created the ridges.',

The researchers found that, due to slight differences in feather shape, the feathers of migratory forked-tailed ycatcher males make a sound during ight that is higher pitched than that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males. The researchers hypothesize that fork-tailed ycatcher females are attracted to the specic sound made by the males of their own subspecies, and that over time the females’ preference will drive further genetic and anatomical divergence between the subspecies. Which nding, if true, would most directly support Gómez-Bahamón and her team’s hypothesis?",

    optionD:
      "D. The breeding habits of the migratory and nonmigratory fork-tailed ycatchers remained generally the same over several generations.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would most directly support Gómez-Bahamón and her team’s hypothesis about fork-tailed ycatchers. The text indicates that although two subspecies of the birds live in the same region, the tail feathers of the migrating males make a higher-pitched sound than the tail feathers of the nonmigrating males do. Gómez-Bahamón and her team hypothesize that female fork-tailed ycatchers are attracted to the particular sound made by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will bring about additional “genetic and anatomical divergence” between the two subspecies. If it were found that the pitch generated by the tail feathers of migrating males is getting higher over successive generations, it would indicate that the shape of the migrating subspecies’ tail feathers is diverging further from that of the nonmigrating subspecies. And if females continue to prefer the sounds of the males of their own subspecies, the females of the migrating subspecies will become acclimated to increasingly higher pitches over subsequent generations, causing further divergence between the subspecies. Thus, if it were found that migrating males’ tail feathers were producing higher pitches over time, that would support the researchers’ hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis is that female ycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This nding is about the shape of wing feathers and how that affects long-distance ight, whereas the hypothesis is about the shape of tail feathers and how that relates to female mate preference. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis is that female ycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This nding focuses on how the tail feather sounds communicate different messages, which doesn’t address differences between the subspecies or female preferences. Choice D is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis is that female ycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. The nding that breeding habits haven’t changed for either subspecies does not, by itself, suggest anything about female preferences or divergence between the two subspecies.",

      "Some ethicists hold that the moral goodness of an individual’s actions depends solely on whether the actions themselves are good, irrespective of the context in which they are carried out. Philosopher L. Sebastian Purcell has shown that surviving works of Aztec (Nahua) philosophy express a very different view. Purcell reveals that these works posit an ethical system in which an individual’s actions are judged in light of how well they accord with the individual’s role in society and how well they contribute to the community. To the extent that these works are representative of Aztec thought, Purcell’s analysis suggests that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. the Aztecs would have disputed the idea that the morality of an individual’s actions can be assessed by appealing to standards of behavior that are independent\nof the individual’s social circumstances.",
    optionB:

    optionD:
      "D. similar actions performed by people in different social roles in Aztec society would have been regarded as morally equivalent unless those actions led to\ndifferent outcomes for the community.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about Aztec (Nahua) ethics. The text indicates that, according to Purcell’s interpretation of available Aztec philosophical works, the Aztec ethical system views an individual’s actions in relation to that individual’s societal role and how the actions affect the community. The text contrasts this view with another held by some ethicists, namely that actions are morally good or bad regardless of the context in which they occur. Thus, Purcell’s analysis suggests that the Aztecs would have asserted that the morality of an individual’s actions are rooted in that person’s position in the community and the actions’ effects and therefore cannot be determined in the absence of that context. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that morally judging an action according to Aztec ethics requires an understanding of the action’s effects and the individual’s social circumstances, it does not specify that only members of that society can acquire this information. Choice C is incorrect because it implies that the Aztecs considered some actions good or bad regardless of the surrounding context, which contradicts the text’s claim that the Aztecs believed that the morality of an individual’s action is dependent on the action’s effects on the community and the person’s specic circumstances. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that in Aztec ethics the morality of an action depends in part on how it affects the community, this is only one of the two factors—the other being the person’s societal role—that need to be considered. Therefore, it is possible that two actions with the same effect on the community could be considered morally distinct if they are performed by individuals in different social roles.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. The graph shows that the CNO-treated females were way more active than the CNO-treated males, while the saline-treated males and females (the control groups) had very similar activity levels. This supports the claim that there were sex-specic differences in the mice’s response to neuron activation. Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. All four groups of mice started at nearly the same activity level before treatment (see how all four points are very close together at -4 minutes, meaning four minutes before treatment). Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t complete the assertion. The assertion is about the mice’s response to neuron activation, so we need to include the data about the CNO-treated females and males. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. The line for the CNO-treated males does not show a “substantial decline” until around 122 minutes, and there is no “steep increase” afterward.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim in the text that John is hard-working and dedicated to his job. In the quotation, John is portrayed as spending “early morn to the fall of the afternoon” working hard as a water carrier. John is also described as “so accustomed to bending” while doing his work “that he never thought of straightening” his body, instead remaining deeply focused on his work. These details portray John as a dedicated worker. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation portrays John as happy about heading home after being paid. It doesn’t showcase John being hard at work. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t pertain to John’s commitment to his work; it describes diculties the trac in the city causes John in the performance of his work.

The researchers then compared the time different insect pollinators spent visiting intact pin and thrum owers to the time such pollinators spent visiting the articially damaged pin and thrum owers.

      "D. Pollinators belonging to the genus Habropoda spent 2.7 seconds on intact pin owers and 4.1 seconds on intact thrum owers.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it describes data from the table that support the researchers’ conclusion that the effect of oral damage on time spent per ower varied by both oral morph and the genus of the pollinator. The table presents the average time pollinators spent per oral morph. The data in the table shows that for pin owers, the average time spent per ower by all pollinator genera was higher for owers that had been articially damaged than for intact owers. By contrast, for thrum owers, the difference in time spent on intact and damaged owers is seen for only some pollinator genera. This supports the researchers’ conclusion that both oral morph and the genus of the pollinator are factors involved in the effect that oral damage has on time pollinators spend per ower. Choice B is incorrect. The table shows that pollinators belonging to the genus Xylocopa spent less time on both damaged pin owers and damaged thrum owers than pollinators belonging to the genus Osmia did. Choice C is incorrect. The table shows that the articial damage to the thrum owers led to shorter average times spent by pollinators on those owers for only two of the four pollinator genera represented in the table, not three. Furthermore, this choice doesn’t address the effect the articial damage had on pin owers; thus, even if accurate, this evidence doesn’t support the researchers’ conclusion that both oral morph and pollinator genus affect time spent per ower when a ower has been damaged. Choice D is incorrect. While this statement is true based on the information in the table, it doesn’t provide evidence that supports the researchers’ conclusion that the effect of oral damage on time spent per ower varied by both oral morph and the genus of the pollinator because this choice provides information only about how much time one pollinator genus spent on intact owers.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. It most logically completes the text. The text says that some scientists can’t explain why prolonged deep sleep is so widespread, given that the known benets of sleep don’t seem to make up for how vulnerable it leaves an animal. This suggests that prolonged deep sleep probably has unknown evolutionary benets that make up for the vulnerability. Choice B is incorrect. It doesn’t logically complete the text.

Written in French, which was not the rst language of most Haitians but which was used throughout Europe as the language of international diplomacy, the declaration notes that Haiti will not bring rebellion to other Caribbean nations, promises to respect the sovereignty of its neighbors—widely understood as a reassurance to the United States—and sets up Haiti as an example for future struggles against colonizers (an implicit reference to the many colonies then found in the Americas). So even though the declaration is explicitly addressed to the Haitian people, it’s reasonable to conclude that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. aspects of the declaration were modeled on similar documents from other countries.",

    optionD: "D. the declaration actually had several intended audiences.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. The passage tells us that the declaration was written in a language important to European diplomacy but not most Haitians, states that the declaration included "a reassurance to the United States," and made implicit references to colonies in the Americas. Because of the messages within the declaration that were largely irrelevant to the Haitian people, we can assume that the Haitian people were not the only audience for this document. Choice A is incorrect. There’s no mention in the passage of similar documents in other countries, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect. Although there’s an implicit reference to European governments when the passage discusses how the declaration was written in French, "which was used throughout Europe as the language of international diplomacy," there is no discussion of the French government’s response to the declaration. Therefore, there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the popularity of the revolution and declaration among the Haitian people, so there’s no basis for this inference.',

In the story, a young woman named Odalie attends the annual Mardi Gras carnival in New Orleans, where she lives with her guardian Tante Louise. Dunbar-Nelson portrays Odalie as eager to escape the monotony of her everyday life: ______ Which quotation from “Odalie” most effectively illustrates the claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. “Mardi Gras was a tiresome day, after all, she sighed, and Tante Louise agreed with her for once.”",
    optionB:
      "B. “In the old French house on Royal Street, with its quaint windows and Spanish courtyard green and cool, and made musical by the plashing of the fountain and\nthe trill of caged birds, lived Odalie in convent-like seclusion.”",

    optionD:
      "D. “It was Mardi Gras day at last, and early through her window Odalie could hear the jingle of folly bells on the [participants’] costumes, the tinkle of music, and the\nechoing strains of songs.”",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from “Odalie” to illustrate the claim that Odalie is eager to escape the monotony, or tedious lack of variety, of her everyday life. In the quotation, Odalie describes feeling “shut up” and complains that she has “no companions” except for her “sleepy tante.” Odalie goes on to say that, as a result, her life is “dull” and she is “ready for any new sensation,” meaning she wants a change. This suggests that Odalie wishes to get away from her monotonous everyday life. Choice A is incorrect. Although this quotation includes the word “tiresome,” which means dull, it does so to suggest Odalie’s negative feelings about Mardi Gras, which is a once-a-year celebration, not her feelings about her everyday life. This quotation therefore doesn’t express that Odalie’s everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Choice B is incorrect. Although this quotation ends by saying that Odalie lives in seclusion, or isolation, it doesn’t express that Odalie’s everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Instead, it describes the pleasant qualities of the house Odalie lives in, saying that it has “quaint windows” and a “green and cool” courtyard that is “made musical” by the sounds of a fountain and pet birds. Choice D is incorrect because this quotation describes the lively sounds of a Mardi Gras celebration that Odalie hears through her window, not the monotony of Odalie’s everyday life or her wish to escape.",

      'Choice A is the best answer. It best describes the main idea of the text. The text starts by saying that historians of the Black Power movement are too reliant on openly ideological works, which were written mostly by men, as sources. The text then describes Farmer’s research: she has shown that including other kinds of sources leads to a better understanding of the Black Power movement and the role Black women played in it.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the table to effectively support the claim that book genres that typically require the reader to start at the beginning of the story and read straight through are more commercially successful as e-books than other genres. For each of three years, the table presents four book genres and the percentage of total sales for each genre in e-book format. Cookbooks, a nonction genre, do not require the reader to read straight through. According to the table, 10.5 percent of total cookbook sales in 2016 were in the e-book format. The 2016 percentage of e-book sales was 36.7 percent in the science ction and fantasy genre, which are typically stories read straight through from start to nish. The higher percentage of total sales of the story-based ebooks in 2016 supports the claim in the text. Choice B is incorrect because it compares the e-book sales of romance books in 2006 to those in 2016. Romance books are meant to be read straight through from start to nish. The text claims that books that are not stories and do not require reading straight through are not as commercially successful in e-book format as those that do. As this choice is only comparing e-book sales for one genre, it does not support the claim. Choice C is incorrect because both science ction and fantasy and romance novels are ction books meant to be read straight through from beginning to end. The text claims that books that are not stories and do not require reading straight through are less commercially successful in e-book format than those that do. As this choice does not compare e-book sales of story genres to e-book sales in genres that are not stories, it does not support the claim. Choice D is incorrect. Although the data in the table show that the travel guide ebooks made up a greater percentage of total sales in 2016 than in 2011, this doesn’t illustrate the claim in the text that e-books in nonction genres not meant to be read straight through are less commercially successful.

Planes travel faster than trains, but air travel typically requires 3 hours of lead time for security, baggage handling, and boarding that rail travel doesn’t, so short-haul routes take similar amounts of time by air and by rail. However, the model suggests that as rail passenger volumes approach current capacity limits, long lead times emerge. Therefore, for rail to remain a viable alternative to short-haul ights, ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:

      "C. security, baggage handling, and boarding procedures used by airlines may need to be implemented for rail systems.",
    optionD:
      "D. passengers who travel by rail for these routes will need to accept that lead times will be similar to those for air travel.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. Air travel usually requires much more “lead time” than train travel, so short ights end up taking the same amount of time as a train trip to the same destination. But train travel starts to need more “lead time” when the trains approach their capacity limits. This suggests that train companies should add more trains for these routes if they want to encourage travelers to take a train instead of a plane. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses “long-haul routes” for either air travel or rail travel, so there is no basis to make this inference. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text only mentions these procedures to explain why the “lead time” is so long for air travel. It never suggests that trains need to start implementing these procedures too. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The goal is to make sure that trains “remain a viable alternative” to short ights, which suggests that anything that makes train travel take longer should be avoided.",

      'Choice D is the best answer because it presents the point about the magnetic eld mapping that the text describes as surprising. The text indicates that a team of astronomers mapped the magnetic eld of G47, a galactic bone in the Milky Way, and that the mapping "surprisingly" revealed "no clear pattern or direction" in the magnetic eld. The text then adds that the researchers had thought the magnetic eld would be as uniform as the magnetic elds of other galactic bones in the Milky Way are. In other words, the researchers were surprised that the mapping revealed a magnetic eld that wasn’t uniform. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that the mapping surprisingly showed a weaker magnetic eld than the researchers had expected. The text makes no mention of the magnetic eld’s strength, only its lack of a clear pattern or direction. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that the magnetic eld mapping suggested to researchers that previous mappings were inaccurate. Although the text states that the mapping didn’t show what researchers had expected based on their knowledge of other magnetic elds, there’s no indication that G47’s magnetic eld had ever been mapped before. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the researchers were surprised that the magnetic eld was different from, not similar to, the magnetic elds of other galactic bones; the text states that because other galactic bones in the Milky Way are more uniform, the researchers had expected the magnetic eld of G47 to be more uniform than it turned out to be.',

    question:
      "In many of his sculptures, artist Richard Hunt uses broad forms rather than extreme accuracy to hint at specic people or ideas. In his rst major work, Arachne (1956), Hunt constructed the mythical character Arachne, a weaver who was changed into a spider, by welding bits of steel together into something that, although vaguely human, is strange and machine-like. And his large bronze sculpture The Light of Truth (2021) commemorates activist and journalist Ida B. Wells using mainly owing, curved pieces of metal that create stylized ame. Which choice best states the text’s main idea about Hunt?",
    optionA:
      "A. He often depicts the subjects of his sculptures using an unrealistic style.",
    optionB:
      "B. He uses different kinds of materials depending on what kind of sculpture he plans to create.",
    optionC:
      "C. He tends to base his art on important historical gures rather than on ctional characters.",
    optionD:
      "D. He has altered his approach to sculpture over time, and his works have become increasingly abstract.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, many of Richard Hunt’s sculptures “use broad forms rather than extreme accuracy”—in other words, they are more abstract than realistic. To illustrate Hunt’s abstract approach, the text characterizes his sculpture of Arachne as “vaguely human” and his work in honor of Ida B. Wells as “using mainly owing, curved pieces of metal that create stylized ame.” Thus, the main idea is that Hunt often depicts the subjects of his sculptures using an unrealistic style. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that one of Hunt’s sculptures is made of steel and another of bronze, there is no mention of why he chose these materials. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt chose the subjects for his sculptures. Furthermore, of the two examples provided in the text, only Ida B. Wells is an important historical gure; Arachne is a “mythical character.” Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt’s style changed over time. In fact, although the two examples of Hunt’s work discussed in the text were created 65 years apart, they are both described as heavily stylized rather than realistic, which may suggest that some aspects of Hunt’s style haven’t changed over that time.",

    question:
      "Euphorbia esula (leafy spurge) is a Eurasian plant that has become invasive in North America, where it displaces native vegetation and sickens cattle. E. esula can be controlled with chemical herbicides, but that approach can also kill harmless plants nearby. Recent research on introducing engineered DNA into plant species to inhibit their reproduction may offer a path toward exclusively targeting E. esula, consequently ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA: "A. ",
    optionB: "B. enhancing the ecological benets of E. esula in North Americ",
    optionC: "C. enabling cattle to consume E. esula without becoming sick.",
    optionD:
      "D. reducing invasive E. esula numbers without harming other organisms.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of leafy spurge and engineered DNA. The text establishes that using chemical herbicides to control leafy spurge in North America can also harm other plants nearby. The text then indicates that it might be possible to use engineered DNA to prevent plants from reproducing, which would be useful for “exclusively targeting” leafy spurge. If it’s possible to exclusively target leafy spurge with engineered DNA—meaning that only leafy spurge is affected by the engineered DNA—and prevent the plant from reproducing, then leafy spurge numbers could be reduced “without harming other organisms.” Choice A is incorrect because the text raises the possibility of using engineered DNA to prevent leafy spurge from reproducing, not to make individual leafy spurge plants more vulnerable to chemical herbicides that already exist. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe any ecological benets of leafy spurge in North America; instead, the text is focused on using engineered DNA to prevent leafy spurge from reproducing and thereby reduce its numbers. The only ecological effects of leafy spurge in North America that are described in the text are harmful. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes the possibility of using engineered DNA to prevent leafy spurge from reproducing; it doesn’t offer a way to enable cattle to eat leafy spurge without becoming sick.",

    question:
      "In 2022, researchers rediscovered ancient indigenous glyphs, or drawings, on the walls of a cave in Alabama. The cave’s ceiling was only a few feet high, affording no position from which the glyphs, being as wide as ten feet, could be viewed or photographed in their entirety. However, the researchers used a technique called photogrammetry to assemble numerous photos of the walls into a 3D model. They then worked with representatives of tribes originally from the region, including the Chickasaw Nation, to understand the signicance of the animal and humanoid gures adorning the cave. According to the text, what challenge did the researchers have to overcome to examine the glyphs?",
    optionA:
      "A. The cave was so remote that the researchers couldn’t easily reach it.",
    optionB:
      "B. Some of the glyphs were so faint that they couldn’t be photographe",
    optionC: "C. The researchers were unable to create a 3D model of the cave.",
    optionD:
      "D. The cave’s dimensions prevented the researchers from fully viewing the glyphs.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The text describes the very low ceiling of the cave, making it impossible to photograph the very wide glyphs all at once. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t say this. It never suggests that the cave was remote or dicult to access, just that the cave itself was dicult to photograph well. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn’t say this. The glyphs were so wide that they couldn’t be photographed completely. Choice C is incorrect. The text states the opposite of this.

    optionD:
      "D. in each year shown, Thailand had higher international tourism income than any of the other countries.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the text, providing an example that illustrates that the annual increases in international tourism revenue in 2017 and 2018 weren’t universal. The table shows the annual spending by international tourists (which indicates annual international tourism revenue) in 2016–2018 in four Asian countries. According to the table, annual spending by international tourists in South Korea was $21.0 billion in 2016 and then decreased to $17.2 billion in 2017. This decrease shows that not all of the countries included in the table saw increases in annual international tourism revenue in 2017. Choice A is incorrect because the table doesn’t provide any data regarding revenue from tourism by residents of those countries. Even if that data were provided, it wouldn’t be relevant to the claim that the trend of annual increases in international tourism revenue in 2017 and 2018 was not universal. Choice B is incorrect because the data in the table do not support the statement that Japan’s international tourism revenue was higher in 2016 than it was in 2018: the table indicates that Japan’s annual international tourism revenue was $33.5 billion in 2016, which is less than Japan’s annual international tourism revenue of $45.3 billion in 2018. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table does indicate that Thailand’s revenue from international tourism was higher than that of the other three Asian countries in 2016, 2017, and 2018, this information has no direct bearing on the text’s claim that not all the Asian countries represented in the table saw an increase in revenue from international tourism.",

      "East Australian humpback whales migrate up to 10,000 kilometers each year to reach their breeding grounds. Researchers long believed that migrating whales live only on the extra energy they stored up during the feeding season. But marine biologist Vanessa Pirotta and her team aren’t so sure. They analyzed 20 years of observations of the migrating whales made by citizen scientists (members of the public who help collect data for scientic research). The team claims that the whales may not live only on their stored energy during migration. Which nding, if true, would most directly support the team’s claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. Citizen scientists have observed many different types of marine animals feeding alongside the whales.",
    optionB:
      "B. Citizen scientists have made many observations of the whales feeding as they migrate to their breeding grounds.",

    optionD:
      "D. Citizen scientists have recently begun to observe the whales migrating to their breeding grounds earlier in the year.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would most directly support Pirotta and her team’s claim that East Australian humpback whales may not live only on stored energy during migration. The text explains that it has long been thought that East Australian humpback whales store extra energy during the feeding season and then use that energy to survive while traveling to their breeding grounds. If it were true that citizen scientists have often seen the whales feeding as they migrate to the breeding grounds, that would indicate that the whales sometimes feed and take in additional energy during the journey, meaning that they may not rely only on energy they stored before migrating. Choice A is incorrect because nding that citizen scientists have observed many different types of marine animals feeding alongside the whales would have no bearing on the team’s claim; the behavior of other animals is irrelevant, and without indicating the timing of the observed feeding, the nding wouldn’t reveal whether the whales rely only on previously stored energy or ever take in additional energy during migration. Choice C is incorrect because nding that citizen scientists have more often observed whales on the way to their breeding grounds than returning to their feeding grounds would have no bearing on the team’s claim. Since it would provide information about the timing of observations but not about the whales’ observed activities, the nding wouldn’t reveal whether the whales rely only on previously stored energy or ever take in additional energy during migration. Choice D is incorrect because nding that citizen scientists have recently started seeing the whales migrate to their breeding grounds earlier in the year would have no bearing on the team’s claim. Since it would provide information about a change in the timing of migration but not about the whales’ observed activities while migrating, the nding wouldn’t reveal whether the whales rely only on previously stored energy or ever take in additional energy during migration.",

      "Some astronomers searching for extraterrestrial life have proposed that atmospheric NH (ammonia) can serve as a biosignature gas—an indication that a planet harbors life. Jingcheng Huang, Sara Seager, and colleagues evaluated this possibility, nding that on rocky planets, atmospheric NH likely couldn’t reach detectably high levels in the absence of biological activity. But the team also found that on so-called mini-Neptunes—gas planets smaller than Neptune but with atmospheres similar to Neptune’s—atmospheric pressure and temperature can be high enough to produce atmospheric NH Based on the text, Huang, Seager, and colleagues would most likely agree with which statement about atmospheric NH ?",
    optionA:
      "A. Its presence is more likely to indicate that a planet is a mini-Neptune than that the planet is a rocky planet that could support life.",
    optionB:
      "B. Its absence from a planet that’s not a mini-Neptune indicates that the planet probably doesn’t have life.",
    optionC:
      "C. It should be treated as a biosignature gas if detected in the atmosphere of a rocky planet but not if detected in the atmosphere of a mini-Neptune.",
    optionD:
      "D. It doesn’t reliably reach high enough concentrations in the atmospheres of rocky planets or mini-Neptunes to be treated as a biosignature gas.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it states a conclusion the researchers likely agree with, given the details in the text. The text explains that a biosignature gas is a gas that can be used as an indicator that a planet harbors some form of life and some astronomers have proposed that NH could serve as a biosignature gas. The researchers evaluating this claim found that the atmosphere of rocky planets would be unlikely to reach "detectably high levels" of NH without biological activity, which would support the proposal of NH serving as a biosignature gas. However, the text also states that mini-Neptune planets can produce NH in the absence of biological activity. Thus, the text is structured to lead to the conclusion that detectable levels of NH in the atmospheres of rocky planets could constitute a biosignature, but that is not the case for detectable levels of the gas in the atmospheres of mini-Neptune planets. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that biological activity likely accounts for detectable levels of NH in the atmospheres of rocky planets but miniNeptune planets can have detectable levels of NH in their atmospheres in the absence of biological activity. Therefore, both rocky planets and mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of atmospheric NH . Choice B is incorrect because the text states that for NH to reach detectable levels in the atmospheres of rocky planets likely means they harbor biological activity, meaning that rocky planets with detectable NH usually harbor biological activity. However, that does not entail that every rocky planet with biological activity will have detectable levels of NH in their atmospheres. Choice D is incorrect because the text claims only that some astronomers have proposed using NH as a biosignature gas without mentioning a minimum concentration of atmospheric NH that must be met for it to function as a biosignature gas.',

Three of the moons have prograde orbits (orbiting in the direction the planet spins), and the other 17 have retrograde orbits (orbiting in the opposite direction of the planet’s spin). All but one of the 20 moons are thought to be remnants of bodies that orbited Saturn until they broke apart in collisions. Although the one exceptional moon orbits in the same direction as the planet’s spin, its orbit is highly eccentric compared to the rest, which may suggest that it has a different origin than the other 19 moons. Based on the text, which choice best describes the moon with the eccentric orbit?",
    optionA:
      "A. It doesn’t have a retrograde orbit, but it likely has the same origin as the moons with retrograde orbits.",
    optionB:
      "B. Its orbit is so tilted with respect to the other moons’ orbits that it’s neither prograde nor retrograde.",
    optionC:
      "C. It has a prograde orbit that is likely the result of having collided with another body orbiting Saturn.",
    optionD:
      "D. It has a prograde orbit and may not be a remnant of an earlier body that orbited Saturn.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the moon with the eccentric orbit. The text indicates that three of the 20 newly discovered moons have prograde orbits, meaning that they orbit Saturn in the same direction as the planet’s spin, while the other 17 moons have retrograde orbits, meaning that they orbit Saturn in the opposite direction of the planet’s spin. The text then states that 19 of the 20 moons appear to be the remains of earlier bodies that orbited Saturn but were broken apart in collisions. The one exception is a moon that orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet’s spin, meaning that the exceptional moon’s orbit is prograde. The text goes on to state that the exceptional moon’s orbit is so eccentric that the moon may have formed through a different process than the other 19 moons. The moon with the eccentric orbit, therefore, has a prograde orbit and may not be a remnant of an earlier body that orbited Saturn. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text supports the idea that the moon with the eccentric orbit likely has the same origin as the moons with retrograde orbits. Although it’s true that the moon has a prograde orbit (and thus doesn’t have a retrograde orbit), the only information the text provides about the moon’s origin is that it may be different than the origin of the other 19 moons. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the moon in question orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet’s spin, meaning that the moon’s orbit is prograde, not that its orbit is neither prograde nor retrograde. Choice C is incorrect because the text merely notes that the moon in question has a prograde orbit without giving any indication of what likely caused that orbit.",

    question:
      "The Post Oce is a 1912 play by Rabindranath Tagore, originally written in Bengali. The character Amal is a young boy who imagines that the people he sees passing the window of his home are carefree even when engaged in work or chores, as is evident when he says to the daughter of a ower seller, ______ Which quotation from The Post Oce most effectively illustrates the claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. “I see, you don’t wish to stop; I don’t care to stay on here either.”",
    optionB:
      "B. “Oh, ower gathering? That is why your feet seem so glad and your anklets jingle so merrily as you walk.”",
    optionC:
      "C. “I’ll pay when I grow up—before I leave to look for work out on the other side of that stream there.”",
    optionD:
      "D. “Wish I could be out too. Then I would pick some owers for you from the very topmost branches right out of sight.”",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that Amal imagines the people he sees are carefree even when engaged in work. In the quotation, Amal observes that the ower seller’s daughter is “ower gathering,” or working, as the text indicates. Moreover, Amal notes that the daughter’s feet “seem so glad” and her “anklets jingle so merrily,” suggesting that Amal believes that the ower seller’s daughter is cheerful. Choice A is incorrect because the quotation makes no observation about the cheerful mood of the ower seller’s daughter. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation discusses how Amal envisions his future, not the feelings of the ower seller’s daughter. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation discusses Amal’s wishes, not the feelings of the ower seller’s daughter.",

      "In the 1960s, Chavela Vargas became an unlikely star in ranchera, a style of traditional Mexican music. Most ranchera singers had clear, polished voices and performed with a full band. But Vargas accompanied her raspy voice with just her guitar. Dressed in men’s trousers and a poncho, she would perform classic songs that had been written from a male point of view and were usually sung by men. She also altered those songs by performing them much more slowly than other ranchera singers did. The slower tempo allowed her to express the emotional quality of the lyrics more fully. According to the text, what is one way that Vargas differed from other ranchera singers?",
    optionA: "A. She possessed a voice that was clear and polishe",
    optionB: "B. She avoided singing songs written from a male point of view.",
    optionC: "C. She disliked performing classic songs.",
    optionD: "D. She altered classic songs by slowing them down.",

According to the text, Vargas differed from other ranchera singers by slowing the tempo of classic songs, which allowed her to express the emotional quality of the lyrics more fully. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that Vargas possessed an unusually raspy voice for a ranchera singer, not a clear and polished voice. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Vargas was known to perform songs written from a male point of view, not that she avoided such songs. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Vargas disliked performing classic songs. Rather, it suggests that she found innovative ways of performing them to emphasize their emotional content, which seems to suggest an anity for such songs, not dislike.",

    optionA:
      "A. The narrator feels a growing sense of isolation even though his companions are nearby during the balloon ride.",
    optionB:
      "B. The narrator and his companions are completely absorbed in the change in perspective they gain while riding in the balloon.",
    optionC:
      "C. The narrator and his companions are troubled by the disorienting effects of the altitude while riding in the balloon.",
    optionD:
      "D. The narrator is pleasantly surprised by his companions’ unrestrained enthusiasm about the sensation of riding in the balloon.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The narrator describes the view he and his companions have from the balloon: the earth lies beneath "milky vapors," and the balloon itself looks like another moon. The narrator goes on to explain how the people riding in the balloon are affected by the ride, explaining that they are immersed in the experience: oating along in "delicious inertia," or inactivity, like "silent, joyous, irresponsible beings." Thus, the main idea is that the narrator and his companions are completely absorbed in the change in perspective they gain while riding in the balloon. Choice A is incorrect because the narrator never describes himself as feeling isolated from his companions; instead, he characterizes riding in the balloon as an experience he is sharing with them. And although he does imply a sense of isolation, it is isolation from those on the ground, as when he says of himself and his companions, "We are now alone." Choice C is incorrect because the narrator doesn’t suggest that he or his companions are troubled by the effects of the balloon ride. Instead, he describes himself and his companions as "joyous" and the experience of oating in the balloon as "delicious." Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator is surprised by his companions’ response to the balloon ride. In fact, the text indicates that the narrator and his companions are having the same experience: they’re described as "silent" and "motionless," rather than as having unrestrained enthusiasm.',

      "D. Each of the planets has a mass greater than 0.25 Jupiters, and all except for TOI-1478 b have an orbital period of less than 10 days.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Rodriguez and colleagues’ assertion about the classications of the ve new gas exoplanets. The text describes two categories of gas planets: hot Jupiters, which have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, and warm Jupiters, which have the same mass characteristic but have orbital periods of more than 10 days. According to the table, four of the gas exoplanets discovered by Rodriguez and colleagues have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, while one of the planets has a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of more than 10 days. These data therefore support Rodriguez and colleagues’ assertion that four of the new exoplanets are hot Jupiters and one is a warm Jupiter. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table shows that TOI-628 b has a mass equivalent to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that one of the planets—TOI-1478 b—does indeed have an orbital period of more than 10 days. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table does show that the masses of the ve planets range from 0.85 to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that TOI-1478 b has an orbital period of 10.180 days, not 153 days. Choice C is incorrect. According to the table, TOI-1333 b has an orbital period of only 4.720 days, not more than 10 days. Additionally, although the table does show that all the planets have a radius between 1.060 and 1.771 Jupiters, the text indicates that a planet may be classied as a hot Jupiter or a warm Jupiter based on its mass and orbital period, not on its radius, making the information about the range of the ve planets’ radius values irrelevant.",

Since an aerial robot must lift its own weight along with its cargo, engineer Jiawei Meng and colleagues used a ratio of each robot’s holding force to the robot’s weight to calculate payload capacity, with higher ratios corresponding to greater capacity, concluding that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. Assessment SAT Test Reading and Writing Domain Information and Ideas Skill Command of Evidence Diculty Which choice best describes data in the graph that support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion?",

      "C. The Yale Model T has a lower holding force than the Permanent Magnet Hand despite weighing more.",
    optionD:
      "D. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T does.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data in the graph that support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. According to the text, payload capacity is calculated by using a ratio of a robot’s holding force to the robot’s weight, and higher ratios indicate a greater payload capacity. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a holding force of 56 newtons, four times greater than that of the Yale Model T. Additionally, the graph shows that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a weight of approximately 500 grams, slightly more than the Yale Model T’s weight of approximately 480 grams. Therefore, the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher ratio of holding force to weight than the Yale Model T. Since higher ratios correspond to greater payload capacity, the information from the graph indicating that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T combined with the information in the text ultimately supports the conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. Choice A is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that both the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T weigh more than 450 grams, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the two robots. Choice B is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T both weigh more than the Permanent Magnet Hand does, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Furthermore, the comparison to the Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the claim about the relative ratios and payload capacities of the UltraFast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that the Yale Model T has a lower holding force than the Permanent Magnet Hand, the graph provides no information about holding force. Moreover, information about the Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the conclusion by Meng and colleagues, which only concerns the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T.",

    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. This nding would most strongly support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. This nding suggests that the sail helped the dinosaur make sharp turns more quickly, which supports that hypothesis. Choice B is incorrect. This nding wouldn’t necessarily support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. It’s unclear how the sail displacing more water would relate to that hypothesis—it doesn’t seem to be relevant. Choice C is incorrect. This nding wouldn’t necessarily support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. It’s unclear how the difference in battery power between the models would relate to that hypothesis—it doesn’t seem to be relevant. Choice D is incorrect. This nding would actually weaken the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey.

      "Overgrazing by purple sea urchins has caused many kelp forests along North America’s west coast to be replaced by urchin barrens—areas stripped of vegetation and covered in purple sea urchins. Urchins in barrens persist in a state of starvation that lessens their nutritional value—and thus their appeal—to many predators. Sarah Gravem and colleagues placed sunower sea stars, a once-abundant predator species suffering massive population declines in recent years, in aquariums that each contained a nutritionally poor and a nutritionally rich purple sea urchin. The researchers found that the sea stars selected the nutritionally rich urchin in 42.7% of trials and the nutritionally poor urchin in 37.5% of trials, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",

      "A. sunower sea stars are willing to hunt sea urchins, but if given a choice, they will prey on other more nutritious marine animals instea",
    optionB:
      "B. sunower sea stars are reluctant to feed on both nutritionally poor and nutritionally rich sea urchins and are therefore unlikely to thrive in kelp forests.",
    optionC:

    optionD:
      "D. sunower sea stars do not always avoid foraging on nutritionally poor sea urchins, making sunower sea star population recovery a potentially important tool\nfor controlling urchin barrens.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the researchers’ ndings about purple sea urchins and sunower sea stars. The text explains that urchin barrens are areas that used to be kelp forests but are now covered by purple sea urchins. The text suggests that because there is no more vegetation to be consumed in those areas, the urchins exist in a state of starvation that makes them less nutritional for many predators. The text goes on to explain that in a study with a choice between two purple sea urchins, sunower sea stars (a predator species that has been substantially declining) consumed a nutritionally rich urchin 42.7% of the time and a nutritionally poor urchin 37.5% of the time. Because the sunower sea stars didn’t always avoid consuming nutritionally poor urchins, even when nutritionally rich ones were available, it follows that helping sunower sea star populations to grow could help control urchin barrens by increasing the number of sea stars that may consume and thus remove nutritionally poor purple sea urchins from barrens. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates only that when presented with purple sea urchins, the sunower sea stars in the study consumed both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor ones. It doesn’t suggest that sunower sea stars generally prefer other marine animals that are more nutritious; there’s no mention of other marine animals. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that sunower sea stars are generally reluctant to feed on sea urchins. In fact, the text indicates that the sunower sea stars in the study did consume sea urchins, feeding on both nutritionally poor and nutritionally rich ones. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses only the willingness of sunower sea stars to consume the type of sea urchins found in barrens (nutritionally poor sea urchins), not how likely other species of sea stars are to consume them.",

Powers adapted the lm’s screenplay from his 2013 play, which he wrote after learning about a 1964 meeting that took place in Miami, Florida, between four prominent gures of the Civil Rights movement: Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, and Sam Cooke. The student claims that although Powers was inspired by this meeting, the lm is best understood not as a precise retelling of historical events but rather as a largely imagined but informed representation of them. Which quotation from an article about One Night in Miami... would be the most effective evidence for the student to include in support of this claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. “When Powers learned of the meeting, he initially planned to write a much longer work about its four famous participants rather than focusing on the meeting\nitself.”",

      "D. “Powers could nd only the most supercial historical details about the meeting, so he read extensively about the four individuals and their thinking at the time\nin an effort to portray what might have happened between them.”",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it provides a quotation that effectively supports the student’s claim about the lm One Night in Miami…. The quotation states that in researching the play on which the lm was based, Kemp Powers only found supercial details about what actually happened during the 1964 meeting in Miami between four leading Civil Rights leaders, meaning that there is very little information about the meeting in the historical record. In the absence of greater details, it wouldn’t have been possible for the lm to be a precise retelling of the historical events it depicts. The quotation explains that to compensate for this lack of information about the meeting, Powers did extensive research into the four gures and how they thought at the time in order to speculate in an informed way about what they might have said or what might have occurred between them. Therefore, the quotation effectively supports the claim that the lm is best understood not as a precise retelling of a historical event but as a deeply informed imaginative rendering of that event. Choice A is incorrect. Although the quotation discusses how on learning about the 1964 meeting in Miami, Powers was inspired to write a play and, later, to adapt it into a screenplay, it doesn’t discuss Powers’s approach to representing what had occurred in the meeting. Instead, it states that Powers didn’t initially plan to write a story only “focusing on the meeting itself” but rather had considered writing a “much longer” and more expansive work about the meeting’s four participants. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t discuss Powers’s approach to representing historical events in his play and in the lm; instead, the quotation focuses on the lm’s positive critical reception by mentioning that it received numerous awards and nominations. Choice C is incorrect. Although the quotation references historical events that are discussed directly in the play and lm by explaining how the four historical gures featured in the story engage in political debates about contemporary issues, it doesn’t specify to what extent Powers’s representation of what occurred during the 1964 meeting in Miami is a factual retelling of what happened and how much is an imaginative rendering of what might have happened.

The text says that handshakes create trust, and that the engineers’ goal is to “improve human-robot interactions.” This suggests that they want the robot’s handshake to feel real because they want humans to trust the robot. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses any other types of greetings, so there is no basis to make this inference. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses the appearance of this robot or any other robots, so there is no basis to make this inference. Choice D is incorrect.

The results of the study, therefore, ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",

    optionC: "C. imitator.",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the study of capuchin monkeys’ cognitive abilities. The text explains that the study failed to distinguish between outcomes for the tasks performed by the capuchin monkeys, such that simpler tasks requiring less dexterity, or skill, were judged by the same criteria as tasks that demanded more dexterity. Because the study didn’t account for this discrepancy, the researchers might have assumed that observed differences in performance were due to the abilities of the monkeys rather than the complexity of the tasks. In other words, the results may suggest cognitive differences among the monkeys even though such differences may not really exist. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on the fact that the tasks assigned to the capuchin monkeys in the study varied in diculty and that the variety wasn’t taken into consideration. The text doesn’t suggest that the capuchin monkeys couldn’t perform certain tasks, just that some tasks were more dicult to do. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the study’s results are indicative of the abilities of capuchin monkeys but not of other monkey species; in fact, the text suggests that the results may not even be an accurate reection of capuchin monkeys’ abilities. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that the researchers compared results for articial tasks with those for tasks encountered in the wild, although the tasks described in the text—sliding a panel and putting a straw in a bottle—are presumably articial.",

Using survey data that revealed whether respondents voted in national elections and how knowledgeable respondents are about politics, Charles and Stephens claim that the likelihood of voting is driven in part by potential voters’ condence in their assessments of candidates—essentially, the more informed voters are about politics, the more condent they are at evaluating whether candidates share their views, and thus the more likely they are to vote.

      "D. High-information voters were more likely to identify as strong Democrats or strong Republicans than low-information voters were.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively support Charles and Stephens’s claim about how level of information affects voters. The graph shows the probability of voting for both high- and low-information voters in seven categories of political orientation. Charles and Stephens claim that “the more informed voters are about politics…the more likely they are to vote.” This statement correctly asserts that the graph shows a higher probability of voting for high-information voters than for low-information voters at each of the seven political orientations. Thus, this statement accurately cites data from the graph that support Charles and Stephens’s claim about how level of information affects voters. Choice B is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the only probability in the graph below 50% is for low-information voters categorized as independent (orientation 4), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice C is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the highest probabilities of voting for low-information voters are at the ends of the orientation scale (1 and 7), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice D is incorrect because the graph does not give any information about how many people are represented in any of the categories, so this statement is not based on data from the graph. Furthermore, even if we did have this information, the claim is about how level of information affects voters’ probability of voting, not whether they’re likely to strongly identify with a particular political party.",

      "The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a band of clouds that encircles Earth in the tropics and is a major rainfall source, shifts position in response to temperature variations across Earth’s hemispheres. Data from Huagapo Cave in Peru suggest the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age (circa 1300–1850), but a shift as far into South America as Huagapo should have led to dry conditions in Central America, which is inconsistent with climate models. To resolve the issue, geologist Yemane Asmerom and colleagues collected data from Yok Balum Cave in Central America and compared them with the Huagapo data. They concluded that during the Little Ice Age, the ITCZ may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifted. Which nding from Asmerom and colleagues’ study, if true, would most directly support their conclusion?",
    optionA:
      "A. Neither the Yok Balum data nor the Huagapo data show signicant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age.",
    optionB:
      "B. Both the Yok Balum data and the Huagapo data show increased temperatures and prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age.",
    optionC:
      "C. The Yok Balum data show prolonged dry conditions during the same portions of the Little Ice Age in which the Huagapo data show heightened levels of rainfall.",
    optionD:
      "D. The Yok Balum data and the Huagapo data show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion that the ITCZ may have expanded northward and southward rather than shifting south during the Little Ice Age. The text indicates that the ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tropics that is a signicant rainfall source, can change position. Data from Peru’s Huagapo Cave suggest that the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But according to the text, if the ITCZ moved into South America in that way, then Central America should have been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other words, rainfall should have been reduced in Central America because the ITCZ, a signicant rainfall source, had shifted into South America, but climate models do not show such a reduction in Central America. The text goes on to say that Asmerom and colleagues tried to resolve this apparent conict by collecting data from Yok Balum cave in Central America and comparing them with data from Huagapo, which led the researchers to conclude that the ITCZ may have expanded both northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. If it is true that Yok Balum in Central America and Huagapo in South America show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a nding would support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion by suggesting that the two areas were affected by the same rainfall source, and thus that the ITCZ may have expanded rather than shifted. Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text about how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature in areas where it is located. Rather, the text states that temperature variations across Earth’s hemispheres can shift the position of the ITCZ. Finding that neither Yok Balum nor Huagapo data show evidence of signicant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues’ claim. Choice B is incorrect because nding that both Yok Balum and Huagapo experienced prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age would not support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion that the ITCZ, a major source of rainfall, may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. Dry conditions in both locations would suggest that the ITCZ did not cover either location. Additionally, nding that temperatures were elevated in both locations would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion, since there is no information in the text that indicates how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature. Choice C is incorrect because nding that Yok Balum experienced prolonged dry conditions at the same time that Huagapo experienced high rainfall would weaken Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion, not strengthen it. Such a nding would suggest that the ITCZ shifted south and left Central America dry rather than expanding both northward and southward.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayeld’s suggestion about bite force estimates. According to the text, Barrett and Rayeld believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly inuenced by the methods used to produce them—that is, that different methods may produce signicantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000–57,000 newtons and 35,000–63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000–235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000–34,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are signicantly inuenced by the methodology used to produce them. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayeld’s suggestion that different methodologies may produce signicantly different estimates. However, the table doesn’t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson’s study are accurately described, a single set of ndings from one study using only one methodology can’t show that different methodologies may produce signicantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayeld suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these ndings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the ndings don’t support Barrett and Rayeld’s suggestion that different methodologies may produce signicantly different dinosaur bite force estimates.",

      "Parthenogenesis is a form of reproduction in which a female reproduces without mating. She produces an egg containing a single offspring whose DNA, or genetic material, comes entirely from its mother. Among birds, parthenogenesis has been found in a handful of species, including pigeons and turkeys. When scientists at the San Diego Zoo analyzed the DNA of the zoo’s California condors (a species of vulture), they discovered that two individuals weren’t genetically similar enough to any of the males in the condor enclosure to be their offspring. However, both had hatched from eggs laid by females in the enclosure. Thus, the scientists concluded that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. at least one of those individuals’ mothers was born as a result of parthenogenesis.",

      "C. the mothers of the two individuals probably reproduced through parthenogenesis.",
    optionD:
      "D. California condors reproduce through parthenogenesis only if females lack sucient access to males.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of parthenogenesis as it relates to two California condors at the San Diego Zoo. The text explains that parthenogenesis is a form of reproduction in which a female reproduces without mating, producing an egg containing an offspring with DNA that comes entirely from its mother. After noting examples of parthenogenesis among birds, the text then reports on a discovery at the San Diego Zoo. According to the text, scientists at the zoo found that two of the zoo’s California condors weren’t similar enough to any of the zoo’s male condors to be their offspring. Given that parthenogenesis occurs without mating and results in an offspring with DNA entirely from its mother, it can reasonably be inferred that the scientists concluded that the mothers of the two condors probably didn’t mate with any of the male condors at the zoo, reproducing through parthenogenesis instead. Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that at least one of the condors’ mothers was born as a result of parthenogenesis. Rather, the text suggests that the two condors were themselves both probably born as a result of parthenogenesis, which would account for their lack of strong genetic resemblance to any of the male condors in the zoo’s condor enclosure. Choice B is incorrect because the text never discusses wild California condors, only California condors living at the San Diego Zoo. For this reason, the text doesn’t support a conclusion that distinguishes between how California condors reproduce in zoos and how they reproduce in the wild. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that the zoo’s female condors lacked sucient access to males or that this would be a cause of parthenogenesis, indicating only that the condor enclosure included males.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of accelerated owering in A. thaliana plants. The text indicates that A. thaliana plants show accelerated owering at high temperatures. To investigate the mechanism for this accelerated owering, biologists replaced the ELF3 protein in one group of A. thaliana plants with a similar protein found in another plant species that doesn’t show accelerated owering. The team then compared these modied plants to A. thaliana plants that retained their original ELF3 protein. The text states that the two samples of plants showed no difference in owering at 22° Celsius, but at 27° Celsius the unaltered plants with ELF3 showed accelerated owering while the plants without ELF3 didn’t. If accelerated owering at the higher temperature occurred in the A. thaliana plants with ELF3 but not in the plants without the protein, then ELF3 likely enables A. thaliana to respond to increased temperatures. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention whether any plants other than A. thaliana and stiff brome show temperature-sensitive owering, so there is no support for the idea that this type of owering is unique to A. thaliana. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the effects of ELF3 and not the production of it. There’s nothing in the text to suggest that the amount of ELF3 in A. thaliana varies with temperature. Choice D is incorrect. While the text states that there was no difference in the owering of modied and unmodied A. thaliana plants at 22° Celsius, there’s no suggestion that A. thaliana only begins to ower at 22° Celsius; the text doesn’t mention a specic temperature threshold required for A. thaliana owering.",

The passage explains that heliographs “were largely effective only during the daytime” and that “the range of the device depended on factors such as the opacity of the air and line of sight.” These constraints would have greatly limited the use of the heliograph, so we can infer that this would have been a reason to replace it with new technology. Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t discuss the production and maintenance of heliographs, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention any “other purposes” that a heliograph wouldn’t work for, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention knowledge of Morse code as a particular problem with the use of heliographs, so there’s no basis for this inference.",

    question:
      "The recovery of a 1,000-year-old Chinese shipwreck in the Java Sea near present-day Indonesia has yielded a treasure trove of artifacts, including thousands of small ceramic bowls. Using a portable X-ray uorescence analyzer tool, Lisa Niziolek and her team were able to detect the chemical composition of these bowls without damaging them. By comparing the chemical signatures of the bowls with those of the materials still at old Chinese kiln sites, Niziolek and her team can pinpoint which Chinese kilns likely produced the ceramic bowls. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Because of a new technology, researchers can locate and recover more shipwrecks than they could in the past.",
    optionB:
      "B. Researchers have been able to identify the location of a number of Chinese kilns in operation 1,000 years ago.",
    optionC:
      "C. With the help of a special tool, researchers have determined the likely origin of bowls recovered from a shipwreck.",
    optionD:
      "D. Before the invention of portable X-ray uorescence, researchers needed to take a small piece out of an artifact to analyze its components.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, thousands of ceramic bowls were found in a recovered Chinese shipwreck. The text goes on to say that Niziolek and her team used a special tool, a portable X-ray uorescence analyzer, to determine the bowls’ chemical signatures. Comparing these chemical signatures with the chemical signatures of materials they had collected from old Chinese kiln sites, the text says, allowed the researchers to identify which kilns had produced the bowls. In other words, the researchers determined the bowls’ origin. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the researchers used technology in the form of a portable X-ray uorescence analyzer, it doesn’t specically state that this technology is new. In addition, the text says that Niziolek and her team used the tool to determine the chemical composition of bowls that were found in a Chinese shipwreck, not to locate and recover the shipwreck itself. There’s no indication in the text that a new technology can help researchers locate and recover shipwrecks. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the researchers collected materials from old kiln sites for chemical comparison with the ceramic bowls, which means that the researchers must have already known the location of those kiln sites. Rather than identifying the location of the kilns, the researchers determined which kilns in operation 1,000 years ago had likely produced the bowls that were found in the shipwreck. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text says that using a portable X-ray uorescence analyzer tool enabled Niziolek and her team to analyze artifacts in the form of ceramic bowls without damaging them, the text doesn’t discuss how researchers analyzed artifacts before this tool was invented. Moreover, the point that the bowls were left undamaged isn’t the text’s main idea. Rather, it’s a detail that’s provided to develop the main idea, which is that the researchers used a special tool to determine where the bowls had been produced.",

    question:
      "Electronic music pioneer Wendy Carlos is credited with the music for three feature lms: A Clockwork Orange (1971), The Shining (1980), and Tron (1982). However, her musical score for A Clockwork Orange is mostly made up of her arrangements of Ludwig van Beethoven’s work. Also, almost all the music that she and Rachel Elkind composed for The Shining was unused by director Stanley Kubrick. It did not appear in the lm. Of the three lms, Tron is the one in which audiences can hear the most of Carlos’s original compositions. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Of the three lms for which Carlos is credited, Tron features the most original music from her.",
    optionB:
      "B. The director of The Shining used most of the music that Carlos composed for it.",

      "C. Beethoven is widely considered to be a more important composer than Carlos.",
    optionD:
      "D. Carlos is a notable innovator among lm composers in the 1970s and 1980s.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it best states the main idea of the text. The text indicates that Wendy Carlos scored three feature lms: A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Tron. It also indicates that Carlos’s work on A Clockwork Orange consisted primarily of electronic arrangements of Beethoven compositions and that very little of what she and Rachel Elkind composed for The Shining was used in the lm. But the soundtrack for Tron consists largely of music composed by Carlos, so it contains more of her original music than do the soundtracks for the other two lms. Thus, the main idea of the text is that of the three lms for which Carlos is credited, Tron features the most original music from her. Choice B is incorrect because it directly contradicts the text’s claim that "very little of what she and Rachel Elkind composed for The Shining was used in the lm." Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the perceived quality of different composers, instead, it discusses how much of Carlos’s original work was used in each of the three lms she scored. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t relate to any of the major themes of the text: the work Wendy Carlos did for three feature lms, how much of that work was composed by Carlos, and how much of her original work was ultimately used in the lm.',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the table to complete the claim about the signicance of the Chang’e 5 lunar samples. The table shows the approximate ages of lunar samples from four different missions: three Apollo missions and the Chang’e 5 mission. The Chang’e 5 samples are said to be approximately 2 billion years old, while the Apollo samples are each said to be more than 3 billion years old. In other words, based on the data in the table, the Chang’e 5 samples are much younger than those from the Apollo missions. Choice B is incorrect because the table shows that the Chang’e 5 samples were taken from a landing site at Oceanus Procellarum, which none of the Apollo missions are shown to have visited. Choice C is incorrect because the table shows the Apollo 17 samples as approximately 3.8 billion years old, the Apollo 15 samples as approximately 3.3 billion years old, and the Chang’e 5 samples as approximately 2 billion years old, and therefore, the Chang’e samples are closer in age to the Apollo 15 samples than they are to the Apollo 17 samples.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. Electra states that she “knows her own passion,” which shows that she’s aware of the intensity of her grief. But she also claims that the “causes are so dire”—meaning the reasons for her grief are so awful—that she can’t let it go, which shows that she believes her grief is justied. Choice A is incorrect.

      "Choice D is the best answer. The text says that N.pudica’s prey-catching pitchers are underground. It also says that the ridges where N. pudica lives don’t have many plants and animals on the surface. This suggests that N. pudica evolved underground pitchers in order to catch more prey. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never mentions the possibility of other undiscovered carnivorous plant species in Indonesia, so there’s no basis to make this inference. Choice B is incorrect.

      "By running computer simulations of the development of our solar system, André Izidoro, Rajdeep Dasgupta, and colleagues concluded that the Sun may have been surrounded by three giant dust rings before the planets started to form. The researchers suggest that the materials in the innermost ring became the four planets closest to the Sun, the materials in the middle ring produced the rest of the planets, and the materials in the outermost ring created the asteroids and other small bodies in the region beyond Neptune. In one simulation, the researchers delayed the initial formation of the middle ring, causing oversized super-Earths to begin developing from the innermost ring.

    optionD:
      "D. the innermost ring actually formed into all the planets in our solar system, not just the four closest to the Sun.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically follows from the text’s discussion of André Izidoro, Rajdeep Dasgupta, and colleagues’ computer simulations of our solar system’s development. The text begins by stating that the simulations led the researchers to conclude that the solar system likely formed from three giant dust rings that encircled the Sun. The text explains that the four inner planets, including Earth, formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring. It then explains that in one simulation, the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring—that is, they tested to see what would happen if the middle ring had formed later than it actually did. They found that doing so affected the size of the innermost planets, resulting in oversized superEarths, planets that are much larger than Earth. Since the delayed timing had the effect of changing the size of Earth in the simulation relative to Earth’s real size, it’s reasonable to conclude that the timing of the middle ring’s formation was important in determining Earth’s eventual size. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text explains that when the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring in one simulation, the size of the innermost planets was affected (which suggests that the middle ring likely formed earlier than it did in this simulation), the text doesn’t indicate that this was an initial simulation—that is, a simulation that was conducted before other simulations. Moreover, the text makes no reference to the specic results of any other simulations; therefore, there is no basis for comparing any conclusions based on the simulation in which the middle ring’s formation was delayed with conclusions based on other simulations. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses how altering the timing of the formation of the middle ring, not the outermost ring, affected the four innermost planets’ eventual size in the researchers’ simulation; therefore, the simulation offers no basis for a conclusion about how the outermost ring’s formation affected the size of the planets. Choice D is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the innermost ring produced all the solar system’s planets. Rather, the text states that the simulations showed that the innermost planets formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring.",

Plant ecologists Anna Abrahão and Patricia de Britto Costa used microscopic analysis to determine that the roots of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha, which grow directly into the quartzite, have clusters of ne hairs near the root tip; further analysis indicated that these hairs secrete both malic and citric acids. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on dissolving underlying rock with these acids, as the process not only creates channels for continued growth but also releases phosphates that provide the vital nutrient phosphorus. Which nding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ hypothesis?",

      "B. macrantha thrive even when transferred to the surfaces of rocks that do not contain phosphates.",
    optionC: "C. The roots of",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support the researchers’ hypothesis about the plants’ dependence on dissolving rock. The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorous, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers’ hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage—such as access to phosphorous—from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don’t benet from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don’t have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benet. Choice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn’t support the researchers’ hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn’t suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benet from dissolving rock. Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock. There’s no information in the text to suggest that the proportion of each acid has any bearing on the process of dissolving rock or on any benets the plants might receive from that process. Choice D is incorrect because if the two species thrive on rocks without phosphates, that would weaken the researchers’ hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock partly because dissolving rock gives them access to phosphates. If the plants can survive on rocks without getting a vital nutrient by dissolving those rocks, then either the nutrient isn’t actually vital for those plants or they can get the nutrient in some way other than by dissolving rocks.",

      "D. dogs from the Near East began to be exchanged for glass beads and other artifacts from Siberi",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of Feuerborn and colleagues’ ndings about sites in Siberia. The text states that genomic analysis of many domesticated dogs from Siberian sites dating from the last 11,000 years revealed that the dogs represented a genetically isolated population of breeds (that is, they didn’t reproduce with dogs of any outside breeds) until about 2,000 years ago, when there is evidence that the dogs began interbreeding with breeds from the Near East. The text also indicates that around the same time, the sites began to contain glass beads and other artifacts seeming to be from the Near East, even though there is no evidence that the people of those sites traveled widely outside Siberia. Because there is evidence of Near East dog breeds and Near East artifacts at Siberian sites beginning about 2,000 years ago but no evidence of the people’s travel to the Near East around that time, it’s reasonable to infer that Feuerborn and colleagues concluded that dogs and artifacts like glass beads were transported to Siberia from the Near East, starting around 2,000 years ago. Choice B is incorrect because the text explicitly states that there is no evidence that the people of the Siberian sites 2,000 years ago traveled extensively beyond Siberia, which they would’ve had to do to reach the Near East; therefore, it wouldn’t make sense to conclude that the presence of Near East dog breeds and artifacts like glass beads suggests that people from Siberia began arriving in the Near East around 2,000 years ago. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses the presence of Near East dog breeds (and evidence of interbreeding with Siberian dogs) and artifacts like glass beads at Siberian sites starting about 2,000 years ago, suggesting only that the dogs and artifacts started to arrive in Siberia around that time. The text doesn’t suggest the purpose of the arrival of the Near East dogs and artifacts or give any indication of Siberian dog breeds being transported elsewhere through trade. Choice D is incorrect because the text addresses the presence of Near East dog breeds and artifacts like glass beads at Siberian sites starting about 2,000 years ago, suggesting only that the dogs and artifacts started to arrive in Siberia around that time; it doesn’t suggest the purpose of this arrival and makes no mention of Siberian glass beads or other artifacts of Siberian origin.",

At busy intersections, this often causes a backup of vehicles waiting to turn left or being prevented from proceeding by left-turning vehicles in front of them. Transportation researcher Vikash V. Gayah claims that in urban areas eliminating the option to turn left at busy intersections— both with and without dedicated left-turn signals—would improve trac ow and, as a result, reduce overall travel times even if such a restriction would require drivers to sometimes travel a slightly longer distance. Which nding, if true, would most directly support the researcher’s claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. In a town that installed left-turn signals at all busy intersections, seven out of ten survey respondents agreed with the statement “the streets in my community\nare easier to navigate by motor vehicle than before.”",
    optionB:
      "B. A trac study of intersections in a large city shows that on average drivers wait longer to make a left turn at intersections without left-turn signals than at\nintersections with such signals.",
    optionC:
      "C. After a city eliminated left turns at busy intersections, a package-delivery company reports that its drivers have been able to reach more addresses in the city\ndaily, on average, and therefore deliver more packages there annually.",
    optionD:
      "D. Statistics reveal that school buses in a city that eliminated left turns at most intersections took on average two minutes longer to complete their routes after the\nrestriction took effect than they did before.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would most directly support Vikash V. Gayah’s claim that eliminating the option to turn left at busy intersections would improve trac ow and reduce overall travel times. The text begins by describing a problem encountered by drivers in countries with righthand trac—namely that drivers wanting to make a left turn must wait for either gaps in oncoming trac or for designated left-turn signals before proceeding. The resulting backup of vehicles causes increased trac congestion at busy intersections that slows overall travel times. According to Gayah, eliminating left turns from busy intersections in urban areas would ease the congestion caused by vehicles waiting to turn left. If vehicles spend less time waiting at intersections for left turns, faster overall travel times would result even if some drivers would have to drive slightly longer distances to make the desired left turn. Drivers for packagedelivery companies, who presumably spend most of the day driving to destinations across the city in which they are based, would likely provide a good indication of overall trac patterns across the city. A nding that after a city had eliminated left turns at busy intersections, package-delivery companies were able to complete more daily deliveries on average—which implies faster travel times between package destinations—would therefore support the claim that overall travel times would decrease if left turns were eliminated at busy intersections. Choice A is incorrect because a nding that a majority of survey respondents agreed with the statement that implementing left-turn signals at all busy intersections made navigating streets in their communities easier wouldn’t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether at some busy intersections—both with and without dedicated left-turn signals—would improve the ow of trac and overall trac times. In fact, the text emphasizes that designated left-turn signals contribute to increased congestion because they require drivers to wait to turn left, which results in a backup of vehicles. Installing such signals at all busy intersections would thus potentially compound the problem of congestion, not improve it. Moreover, although making streets easier for drivers to navigate might indicate that left-turn signals are benecial to drivers, it doesn’t indicate that overall travel times would necessarily be reduced. Choice B is incorrect because a study concluding that drivers wait longer to make left turns at intersections without dedicated left-turn signals than at intersections with such signals wouldn’t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether would reduce overall travel times. In fact, the nding would merely support the idea that installing left-turn signals would likely reduce the time drivers spend waiting at busy intersections that didn’t previously have left-turn signals, not that overall travel times would be reduced. Choice D is incorrect because the nding that after a restriction eliminating left turns at most intersections took effect, school buses took longer to complete their routes than they did before the restriction was implemented would contradict rather than support the researcher’s claim that eliminating left turns would reduce overall travel times.",

    question:
      "A museum curator is writing a biographical statement about Trinidadian-born Chinese dancer, choreographer, and teacher Dai Ailian for a new exhibit on Chinese dance. The curator claims that some of the pieces Dai created shortly after arriving in mainland China in 1941, such as the solo dance Yao Drum, reect a desire to represent the dances of local communities Dai visited during her travels through China. Which quotation from a work by a dance historian would be the most effective evidence for the curator to include in support of this claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. “There is no sound or music accompanying Dai’s movements in Yao Drum, aside from the sounds of drumsticks beating against a drum and against each other.”",
    optionB:
      "B. “Unlike some of the works Dai created in the early 1940s, Yao Drum does not feature a narrative structure, humorous elements, or references to real-life events.”",
    optionC:
      "C. “Yao Drum was inspired by a ceremonial dance Dai witnessed during her time performing eld research among the Yao people in the province of Guizhou in\n1941 or 1942.”",
    optionD:
      "D. “Yao Drum is notable for its intense physicality, with Dai performing sharp jumps, swift turns, and dramatic sweeps of her legs through the air as she moves in\ncircles on the stage.”",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. This choice clearly states that Yao Drum was inspired by a ceremonial dance of the Yao people. This directly supports the curator’s claim that some of Dai’s pieces “represent the dances of local communities” she visited. Choice A is incorrect. This choice discusses the sound and music in Yao Drum, but it doesn’t connect these elements to “the dances of local communities,” which is the focus of the claim. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t mention the dances of local communities, but instead discusses how Yao Drum is different from some of Dai’s earlier works. Choice D is incorrect.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the table to complete the example of variations in participants’ evaluations. The table shows participants’ evaluations of the likelihood that robots could work effectively in different occupations. The text asserts that participants’ evaluations varied widely depending on the occupation being considered and introduces an example supporting that assertion. The data from the table showing that 82% of participants believe that it is somewhat or very likely that a robot could work effectively as a tour guide but only 16% of participants believe that it is somewhat or very likely that a robot could work effectively as a surgeon illustrate this assertion: those data show participants’ views changing substantially with the occupation being considered. Choice A is incorrect because it does not describe data that illustrate the assertion that participants’ evaluations varied widely depending on which occupation was being considered. Although this choice accurately describes data in the table, data about participants’ responses when considering a single occupation—teaching— could not be an example of people’s views changing substantially depending on the occupation being considered. Choice B is incorrect because it identies a similarity in participants’ responses when considering two different occupations, but the assertion that the example is intended to illustrate is that participants’ evaluations varied widely depending on the occupation being considered. Although this choice accurately describes data in the table, those data do not illustrate the assertion in the text. Choice D is incorrect because it does not describe data that illustrate the assertion that participants’ evaluations varied widely depending on which occupation was being considered.

    optionC: "C. It requires proper nourishment in order to thrive.",
    optionD: "D. It perseveres despite challenging circumstances.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a description of how the human mind is like a ower that is directly supported by the text. The text compares the needs of a “fragile and lovely ower” to those of the speaker’s “tender mind”: both need to be fed if they’re going to survive. Without such feeding, they’ll “beginneth straightway to languish,” or weaken. Thus, the text suggests that the human mind is like a ower in that they both need proper nourishment in order to thrive. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the passage of time or describe either the human mind or a ower as becoming increasingly vigorous. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that human minds or owers draw strength from changes in weather. The references to rain in the text pertain to a ower’s need for water rather than the general effects of changing weather. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the human mind or a ower will persist regardless of challenging circumstances.

      "Ancestral Puebloans, the civilization from which present-day Pueblo tribes descended, emerged as early as 1500 B.C.E. in an area of what is now the southwestern United States and dispersed suddenly in the late 1200s C.E., abandoning established villages with systems for farming crops and turkeys. Recent analysis comparing turkey remains at Mesa Verde, one such village in southern Colorado, to samples from modern turkey populations in the Rio Grande Valley of north central New Mexico determined that the latter birds descended in part from turkeys cultivated at Mesa Verde, with shared genetic markers appearing only after 1280. Thus, researchers concluded that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. conditions of the terrains in the Rio Grande Valley and Mesa Verde had greater similarities in the past than they do today.",
    optionB:
      "B. some Ancestral Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s and carried farming practices with them.",
    optionC:
      "C. Indigenous peoples living in the Rio Grande Valley primarily planted crops and did not cultivate turkeys before 1280.",
    optionD:
      "D. the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde likely adopted the farming practices of Indigenous peoples living in other regions.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of Ancestral Puebloans’ migration to the Rio Grande Valley. The text states that in the late 1200s C.E., the Ancestral Puebloan civilization abandoned villages in its original homeland, which included the Mesa Verde site. The text goes on to say that recent genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande Valley descends partly from the ancient turkeys raised at Mesa Verde, and that the genetic markers shared by the two turkey populations rst appeared at Mesa Verde only after 1280 C.E. Therefore, it can reasonably be concluded that some Ancestral Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s and carried their agricultural practices —including the farming of turkeys—to their new home. Choice A is incorrect because the text never compares the condition of the Rio Grande Valley’s terrain to that of Mesa Verde’s terrain, either in the present or in the past. Choice C is incorrect. Although genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande valley descended in part from the turkey population raised by the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde before their migration to the valley in 1280, this nding doesn’t eliminate the possibility that Indigenous peoples living in the valley before 1280 might also have farmed turkeys. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t consider the possibility that before their migration to the Rio Grande Valley after 1280, the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde might have adopted turkey farming from an outside Indigenous civilization in another region; instead, the text provides evidence suggesting that the Ancestral Puebloans brought turkey farming to another region—the Rio Grande Valley—after 1280.",

    optionD:
      "D. To recount fond memories of an afternoon spent in nature with a certain writer",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text. In the rst part of the text, the speaker addresses Paul Laurence Dunbar’s ability to understand people (he has “read the hearts and souls of men” and written of their “joy and mirth”). In the second part of the text, the speaker describes Dunbar’s thorough understanding of the natural world (he has read “the language of the owers” and engaged with “the little brook”). Thus, the text mainly praises Dunbar for being especially perceptive about people and nature. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker describes Dunbar as having read the “hearts and souls of men” and the “language of owers” to convey Dunbar’s ability to comprehend people and nature, not to suggest that Dunbar has literally read any of these things or has read a great deal about them. Choice C is incorrect because the text notes how well Dunbar has made sense of the topics he’s written about but doesn’t address any specic parts of Dunbar’s writing process beyond the suggestion that he used a pen. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on Dunbar’s understanding of people and nature as expressed in his writing.

University of Texas climate scientist Geeta Persad and her colleagues simulated how the amount of water entering aquifers and the amount being used for irrigation purposes would change if this were to occur. Persad and her colleagues concluded that concentration of precipitation into fewer events would result in a higher number of dry days, triggering more irrigation, but that this change in irrigation output is highly sensitive to the baseline concentration of precipitation that currently exists in an area.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the table that support Persad and her colleagues’ conclusion. The text explains that, according to some climate models, precipitation in the western United States will become concentrated into fewer, more intense rain and snow events. According to the text, Persad and her colleagues concluded that more irrigation will consequently be needed but that the change in irrigation output will be highly sensitive to, or greatly affected by, the baseline concentration of precipitation in an area. This conclusion is supported by data from the researchers’ simulations of changes in annual irrigation output in two different scenarios—one in which an area’s annual precipitation is already somewhat concentrated and one in which its annual precipitation is evenly distributed. The table shows that if baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, water use for irrigation will increase only slightly, whereas if baseline precipitation is evenly distributed, water use for irrigation will increase much more—9.0% for surface water and 7.9% for groundwater. This difference illustrates the researchers’ conclusion that the amount of additional water needed for irrigation will vary greatly depending on how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area already is. Choice A is incorrect because it compares changes in the amount of water being used for irrigation to changes in the amount of water entering aquifers. Persad and her colleagues’ conclusion doesn’t focus on changes to the amount of water entering aquifers; rather, the researchers’ conclusion focuses on changes to irrigation output relative to how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area is. Choice C is incorrect because it supports only part of Persad and her colleagues’ conclusion. According to the text, the researchers concluded that the concentration of precipitation into fewer events will trigger more irrigation but that this change in irrigation output will be highly sensitive to an area’s baseline concentration of annual precipitation. The data in this choice support the idea that more irrigation will be needed, but to support the rest of the researchers’ conclusion, additional data from the table are required to show that the increases in water use for irrigation will vary depending on how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area already is. Choice D is incorrect because data in the table indicate no declines in water use for irrigation, showing only increases in the form of positive values.",

    question:
      "Birds of many species ingest foods containing carotenoids, pigmented molecules that are converted into feather coloration. Coloration tends to be especially saturated in male birds’ feathers, and because carotenoids also confer health benets, the deeply saturated colors generally serve to communicate what is known as an honest signal of a bird’s overall tness to potential mates. However, ornithologist Allison J. Shultz and others have found that males in several species of the tanager genus Ramphocelus use microstructures in their feathers to manipulate light, creating the appearance of deeper saturation without the birds necessarily having to maintain a carotenoid-rich diet. These ndings suggest that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. individual male tanagers can engage in honest signaling without relying on carotenoid consumption.",
    optionB:
      "B. feather microstructures may be less effective than deeply saturated feathers for signaling overall tness.",
    optionC:
      "C. scientists have yet to determine why tanagers have a preference for mates with colorful appearances.",
    optionD:
      "D. a male tanager’s appearance may function as a dishonest signal of the individual’s overall tness.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Shultz’s nding about male tanagers. The text explains that because carotenoids both contribute to deeply saturated feathers and offer health benets, having deeply saturated feathers is usually “an honest signal” (a true indication) that a bird is generally t. However, Shultz and others have found that certain male tanagers can appear to have deeply saturated feathers even if they haven’t consumed a diet rich in carotenoids, thanks to microstructures in their feathers that manipulate light. If those birds aren’t necessarily eating carotenoid-rich diets, they may actually be less t than other birds that appear to have similarly saturated feathers; this suggests that a male tanager’s appearance may function as a dishonest signal, or a false indication, of the bird’s overall tness. Choice A is incorrect because Shultz’s nding suggests that some tanagers can signal tness without consuming the carotenoids that contribute to tness, thereby making those signals dishonest, not that tanagers can give honest signals of their tness without consuming carotenoids. Choice B is incorrect because Shultz’s nding suggests that the microstructures in certain tanagers’ feathers can give a dishonest signal of tness, not that the microstructures are less effective than actual pigmentation for signaling tness. Whether the signal of tness is honest or dishonest has no bearing on how effective the signal is: a signal is effective if potential mates behave as though it’s true, regardless of whether it’s actually true. Since there’s no information in the text about how potential mates respond to the dishonest signals of some tanagers, there’s no support for the idea that the dishonest signals are less effective than the honest signals. Choice C is incorrect because Shultz’s nding suggests that certain male tanagers may appear to be tter than they actually are, not that scientists haven’t determined why tanagers prefer mates with colorful appearances.",

The researchers tested B. bufo tadpoles’ responses to different levels of competition by creating ponds with different tadpole population densities but a xed amount of food. Based on analysis of the tadpoles after three weeks, the researchers concluded that increased competition drove bufadienolide production at the expense of growth. Which choice uses data from the table to most effectively support the researchers’ conclusion?",

To test this, the team placed 301 managers in one of three groups. Participants in two experimental groups were asked to reect on a mistake, one group focusing on a mistake that resulted in learning and the other group focusing on a mistake that didn’t result in learning. Participants in a control group were asked to reect on their daily routine. All the participants then described how they would respond to a workplace scenario. After evaluating the responses for evidence of humility, the researchers concluded that their hypothesis was correct. Which choice best describes data in the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion?",
    optionA:
      "A. None of the three groups’ average humility scores exceeded 3.5.",

      "B. The managers in the control group exhibited only slightly less humility on average than the managers in the two experimental groups di",
    optionC:
      "C. The managers who reected on a past mistake that resulted in learning exhibited more humility on average than the managers in the other two groups di",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it describes data in the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion that their hypothesis about workplace leaders and humility was correct. According to the text, Jia Hu and colleagues "hypothesized that workplace leaders who reect on lessons learned from past mistakes are likely to exhibit more humility than leaders who don’t engage in such reection." The bar graph shows the humility scores for managers who participated in Jia Hu and colleagues’ study. It shows average humility scores for managers who reected on a past mistake that they learned from, managers who reected on a past mistake that they didn’t learn from, and managers who were in the control group that, according to the text, simply reected on their daily routines. The graph shows that managers who reected on a past mistake they learned from received an average humility score between 3.0 and 3.5. Both the control group and managers who reected on a mistake they didn’t learn from received a lower average humility score of between 2.5 and 3.0. Thus, the managers who reected on a past mistake that resulted in learning exhibited more humility on average than the managers in the other two groups did. This supports the researchers’ conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct. Choice A is incorrect. Although according to the graph it’s true that none of the group’s humility scores exceeded 3.5, this idea does not support the researchers’ conclusion that their initial hypothesis was correct. The statement that none of the three groups’ average humility scores exceeded 3.5 does not distinguish between those leaders who reected on lessons learned from past mistakes and those who didn’t, so it would not support Hu and colleagues’ hypothesis that workplace leaders who reect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility. Choice B is incorrect. While the graph shows that managers in the control group did exhibit less humility than the experimental group of managers who reected on a mistake they learned from, the graph also shows that the control group exhibited more (not less) humility than the experimental group that reected on a mistake they didn’t learn from. Furthermore, the idea that the managers in the control group exhibited only slightly less humility on average than the managers in the two experimental groups did would not support the researchers’ conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication in the graph that all three groups of participants exhibited less humility on average than the researchers expected. The graph and text don’t cite any specic expectations that the researchers had with regard to the humility scores for each group.',

    question:
      "Swahili Speakers in Three African Countries Country Approximate number of speakers (in millions) Estimated % of population Democratic Republic of the Congo 22 25 Kenya 55 100 Tanzania 61 100 Swahili is estimated to be the rst language of up to 15 million people worldwide. It’s also an ocially recognized language in Tanzania, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which means these countries use Swahili in government documents and proceedings. But even in countries where almost everyone speaks Swahili, for many it isn’t their rst language but is instead their second, third, or even fourth language. Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to support the underlined claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. Tanzania has approximately 61 million Swahili speakers, which is much more than the estimated total number of people worldwide for whom Swahili is their\nrst language.",
    optionB:
      "B. Tanzania is estimated to have at most 15 million Swahili speakers, while the country’s total population is approximately 61 million people.",
    optionC:
      "C. Approximately 100 percent of the people who speak Swahili as their rst language live in Kenya, which has a total population of approximately 55 million\npeople.",
    optionD:
      "D. Approximately 100 percent of Kenya’s population speaks Swahili, while only about 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s population speaks\nSwahili.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the underlined claim. The text indicates that Swahili is the rst language of up to 15 million people worldwide. The text goes on to claim, in the underlined portion, that even in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili, many of the language’s speakers don’t have Swahili as their rst language. The table indicates that 61 million people in Tanzania, which amounts to 100 percent of the population, speak Swahili. If 61 million people in Tanzania speak Swahili, but only 15 million people worldwide have Swahili as their rst language, that means there are many people in Tanzania who speak Swahili as a language other than their rst language. This information about Swahili speakers in Tanzania therefore supports the claim that many Swahili speakers in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili speak it as a language other than their rst language (such as their second, third, or fourth language). Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe information in the table. According to the table, Tanzania has 61 million Swahili speakers, not at most 15 million Swahili speakers. Additionally, the table indicates that 100 percent of Tanzania’s population speak Swahili, which means that the number of Swahili speakers in the country and the country’s total population should be the same, not that they should differ by such a large amount. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no information in the table or the text that indicates where people who speak Swahili as their rst language live. Although Kenya’s total population can be inferred from the table—if Kenya has 55 million Swahili speakers and 100% of Kenya’s population speak Swahili, then Kenya must have a population of 55 million people—nothing suggests that all the people who speak Swahili as their rst language live in a single country, let alone that they all live in Kenya. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table does indicate that 100 percent of Kenya’s population and 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s population speak Swahili, this comparison is irrelevant to the claim that Swahili isn’t the rst language of many of its speakers even in countries where almost everyone speaks Swahili. On its own, a difference in the proportions of the population who speak Swahili cannot reveal whether those Swahili speakers have Swahili as their rst language or a subsequent language.",

      "Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic waste. Areas of the ocean with higher concentrations of microplastic particles also have smaller and fewer waves. A study by Yukun Sun and colleagues found that the concentration of microplastic particles cannot be the only reason for this reduced wave activity because the concentration of particles that would have the observed effect is much higher than that found in these areas of the ocean. However, they found that surfactants, chemicals often used to manufacture plastics, are released into the water from microplastics and have a much stronger wave-reducing effect. According to the text, what did Sun and colleagues discover about surfactants?",
    optionA:
      "A. They have a much stronger effect on wave activity than microplastics alone do.",

    optionD:
      "D. They can be used to contain microplastics within certain areas of the ocean.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about surfactants that is supported by the text. The text indicates that higher concentrations of microplastics have been associated with waves that are relatively small and few. According to the text, however, a study by Sun and colleagues found that concentrations of microplastic particles can’t be the only reason for the reduced wave activity because a much higher concentration of particles is needed to produce that observed effect. Instead, the text indicates that Sun and colleagues found that surfactants are released from microplastics into the ocean and have a much stronger wave-reducing effect than microplastics alone do. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss what surfactants are made of. Instead, it indicates that surfactants are frequently used to manufacture microplastics and that Sun and colleagues discovered that surfactants are released from microplastics into the ocean. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss how microplastics can be removed from the ocean.

      "Hip-hop pedagogy is a form of teaching that’s gaining popularity across school subjects. It involves incorporating hip-hop and rap music into lessons as well as using hip-hop elements when teaching other subject matters. For example, Quan Neloms’s students look for college-level vocabulary and historical events in rap songs. Researchers claim that in addition to developing students’ social justice awareness, hip-hop pedagogy encourages student success by raising students’ interest and engagement. Which nding, if true, would most strongly support the underlined claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. Students tend to be more enthusiastic about rap music than they are about hip-hop musi",
    optionB:
      "B. Students who are highly interested in social justice issues typically don’t sign up for courses that incorporate hip-hop and rap musi",
    optionC:
      "C. Educators report that they enjoy teaching courses that involve hip-hop and rap music more than teaching courses that don’t.",
    optionD:
      "D. Courses that incorporate hip-hop and rap music are among the courses with the highest enrollment and attendance rates.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. Enrollment and attendance are logical ways to measure whether students are interested and engaged. High enrollment and attendance suggests a high level of interest and engagement. Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. Students’ preferences between hip-hop and rap aren’t relevant to the claim, which is focused on whether or not students like classes that use hip-hop pedagogy (which includes the educational use of both hip-hop and rap). Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. While the rst part of the sentence discusses social justice, the underlined claim focuses on student success, which is unrelated. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. This tells us about teacher enjoyment, which isn’t relevant to a claim about student interest and engagement.",

    question:
      "Among social animals that care for their young, such as chickens, macaque monkeys, and humans, newborns appear to show an innate attraction to faces and face-like stimuli. Elisabetta Versace and her colleagues used an image of three black dots arranged in the shape of eyes and a nose or mouth to test whether this trait also occurs in Testudo tortoises, which live alone and do not engage in parental care. They found that tortoise hatchlings showed a signicant preference for the image, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. face-like stimuli are likely perceived as harmless by newborns of social species that practice parental care but as threatening by newborns of solitary species\nwithout parental care.",
    optionB:
      "B. researchers should not assume that an innate attraction to face-like stimuli is necessarily an adaptation related to social interaction or parental care.",
    optionC:
      "C. researchers can assume that the attraction to face-like stimuli that is seen in social species that practice parental care is learned rather than innate.",
    optionD:
      "D. newly hatched Testudo tortoises show a stronger preference for face-like stimuli than adult Testudo tortoises do.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the study by Versace and colleagues. The text indicates that newborn animals of some species are attracted to faces and to stimuli that resemble faces. These species, the text says, share two characteristics: they’re social and they practice parental care, meaning that parents care for their young. The text goes on to describe Versace and colleagues’ experiment, which showed that Testudo tortoises, which aren’t social and don’t practice parental care, were attracted to a stimulus that resembles a face. Since Versace and colleagues have shown that a species that isn’t social and doesn’t practice parental care nevertheless has the innate characteristic of being attracted to face-like stimuli, it follows that this characteristic shouldn’t be assumed to be an adaptation related to social interaction or parental care. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the tortoise hatchlings, which are solitary and don’t practice parental care, were attracted to the face-like stimuli, not that they perceived the stimuli as threatening. Choice C is incorrect because the phenomenon discussed in the text is an attraction to faces and facelike stimuli on the part of newborn animals, which can’t show any learned characteristics since they were just born. Additionally, the text tells us that the tortoises Versace and colleagues studied aren’t social and don’t practice parental care, so any ndings about those tortoises wouldn’t be relevant to the question of whether an attraction to faces in social species that practice parental care is innate or learned. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that adult tortoises were tested on face-like stimuli and, if adults were in fact tested, no information about how they responded is provided. Since no information about adult tortoises’ responses is provided, no conclusion comparing those responses to the responses of newly hatched tortoises can be supported.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement about the forestry student’s project. The table shows ve types of maple trees, each tree’s maximum height, and whether each tree is native to North America. The text indicates that the student needs to recommend a maple tree that’s native to North America and won’t reach a height greater than 60 feet. The red maple is the only tree listed in the table that meets these criteria: its maximum height is 60 feet—meaning that it won’t grow higher than 60 feet—and it’s native to North America. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that the student needs to recommend a tree that’s native to North America and won’t grow higher than 60 feet, but the table shows that the maximum height of the silver maple is 70 feet. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the student needs to recommend a tree that’s native to North America and won’t grow higher than 60 feet, but the table shows that the maximum height of the sugar maple is 75 feet.

      "D. “The color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.”",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that the narrator of "The Yellow Wallpaper" has mixed feelings about her surroundings. She says she is "really getting quite fond of the big room," a positive sentiment, but also describes the room’s wallpaper as "horrid," a negative sentiment. Since some of her feelings about her surroundings are positive and others are negative, they are best described as mixed. Choice A is incorrect because though the narrator describes the room’s wallpaper as "irritating," a negative sentiment, she does not mention a positive sentiment. Thus, the quotation does not effectively illustrate the claim that the narrator has mixed feelings about her surroundings. Choice B is incorrect because it describes how the appearance of the room’s wallpaper changes at night but does not mention the narrator’s feelings about her surroundings. Choice D is incorrect because though the narrator describes the room’s wallpaper as "repellant," a negative sentiment, she does not mention a positive sentiment.

    optionD:
      "D. the aerogel will be less prone to the structural weakness that ultimately causes most other aerogels to break down with use.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of aerogels. The text states that aerogels—highly porous foams—offer "excellent insulation" but typically break down after prolonged exposure to high heat. However, according to the text, Duan and colleagues developed an aerogel that "contracts rather than expands when heated" and recovers its original volume after this contraction. Thus, it is logical to conclude that Duan’s team’s aerogel material will be less prone to the structural weakness that caused earlier aerogels to break down. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that aerogels consist "mainly of tiny air pockets within a solidied gel," it doesn’t mention the number or proportion of air pockets to solidied gel in typical aerogels or in the aerogel developed by Duan’s team. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that the aerogel developed by Duan’s team has a higher, not a lower, ability to withstand exposure to intense heat due to its contraction and subsequent recovery. Choice C is incorrect.

The crows nd a stick without a hook on the ground. The hooked tool is harder to get but is much better than the basic tool at removing prey from holes. When studying New Caledonian crows, ecologist Barbara Klump found that they hold the hooked tools in their claws when not using them, or they carefully put them in a safe place. The crows don’t do the same with the basic tools. This suggests to Klump that the ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",

      "C. crows prefer to share their hooked stick tools but don’t share the stick tools without hooks.",
    optionD:
      "D. crows realize that both kinds of stick tools are less effective than their claws are at removing prey from holes.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the two types of stick tools used by New Caledonian crows. The text indicates that the more effective type of tool has a hook that the crows make themselves, while the other type of tool is simply a stick without a hook that the crows nd and don’t shape in any way. According to the text, Klump found that the crows keep hooked tools—but not the tools without hooks—in their grasp or in safe places when they aren’t using the tools. If the hooked tools are more effective than the tools without hooks are and the crows are more protective of the hooked tools than they are of the tools without hooks, it’s reasonable to conclude that the hooked tools are more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are. Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of how easy it is for the crows to hold either the hooked tools or the tools without hooks. The text does state that crows hold the hooked tools and not the tools without hooks when the tools aren’t in use. However, the text also indicates that the hooked tools require work from the crows to make and are more useful for helping the crows catch prey than the tools without hooks are. This context suggests that the crows hold the hooked tools because they’re more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are, not because the hooked tools are easier to hold. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the crows sharing tools. Additionally, the text indicates that when the crows aren’t using the hooked tools, they either grasp the tools or store them safely, which suggests that the crows try to maintain possession of the hooked tools, not that crows prefer to share those tools. Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about the crows using their claws to remove prey from holes, so there’s no evidence that the crows perceive the stick tools to be less effective than their claws are.",

Choice D is incorrect because the graph shows that the number of computer services jobs was about the same as the number of technical consulting services jobs in 2019, not 2010.

In each year, half the plants were grown using a nitrogen fertilizer, and the other half were grown using a control fertilizer that contained no nitrogen. The researchers concluded that the nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield. Which choice best describes data in the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion?",
    optionA:
      "A. In every year of the experiment, plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer had a yield of at least 30 pounds per acre.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe production. The bar graph shows the cantaloupe yield for plants grown with nitrogen fertilizer and for those grown with a control fertilizer (without nitrogen) for three consecutive years (2017–2019). For each year in the graph, the yield for the nitrogen group is greater than the yield for the control group. In pounds per acre, the value in 2017 for the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 30 while the control-group yield is less than 25; in 2018 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 40 while the control-group yield is less than 35; and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 25 while the control-group yield is less than 20. Thus, these data from the graph strongly support the conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield. Choice A is incorrect because the bar graph shows that in 2019 the nitrogen group had a yield below 30 pounds per acre. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes data in the bar graph—in 2018, the control-group yield is greater than 30 pounds per acre, and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is less than 30 pounds per acre—a claim that the control-group yield exceeds that of the nitrogen group strongly conicts with the researchers’ conclusion that nitrogen fertilizer produces larger yields. Choice D is incorrect. Although it is true that the bar graph shows a higher yield for the nitrogen group in 2018 than in 2017, without the control to compare against, it is impossible to know whether the increase is due to the fertilizer and not, for example, more favorable weather in 2018 than in 2017.",

      "An Ideal Husband is an 1895 play by Oscar Wilde. In the play, which is a satire, Wilde suggests that a character named Lady Gertrude Chiltern is perceived as both extremely virtuous and unforgiving, as is evident when another character says ______ Which quotation from An Ideal Husband most effectively illustrates the claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. “Lady Chiltern is a woman of the very highest principles, I am glad to say. I am a little too old now, myself, to trouble about setting a good example, but I always\nadmire people who do.”",
    optionB:
      "B. “Do you know, [Lady Chiltern], I don’t mind your talking morality a bit. Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike.”",
    optionC:
      "C. “[Lady Chiltern] does not know what weakness or temptation is. I am of clay like other men. She stands apart as good women do—pitiless in her perfection—\ncold and stern and without mercy.”",
    optionD:
      "D. “Lady Chiltern, you are a sensible woman, the most sensible woman in London, the most sensible woman I know.”",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation to illustrate the claim that Lady Gertrude Chiltern is perceived as “both extremely virtuous and unforgiving.” In the quotation, a man describes Lady Chiltern as someone who “does not know what weakness or temptation is.” In other words, the man regards her as someone who is strong and adheres to a strict denition of moral perfection. However, he ironically suggests that this denition excludes mercy and forgiveness—qualities that are also thought of as virtues; according to him, Lady Chiltern is “pitiless in her perfection—cold and stern and without mercy.” This description supports the idea that Lady Chiltern is perceived by others as virtuous as well as unforgiving. Choice A is incorrect. The quotation supports the claim that Lady Chiltern is perceived as virtuous, in that it describes her as “a woman of the very highest principles.” However, it doesn’t characterize her as unforgiving or being perceived as such. Choice B is incorrect. The quotation suggests that Lady Chiltern is concerned with morality, but it suggests that her interest in discussing it is fundamentally hypocritical and functions as a means by which to judge others. However, the quotation doesn’t address the question of whether Lady Chiltern is unmerciful to those who seek forgiveness for harm they have caused. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t address either Lady Chiltern’s perceived virtuousness or her perceived lack of forgiveness; instead, it expresses the belief that she is sensible.",

Using a computer model to study Mimas’s gravitational interactions with Saturn and tidal forces, geophysicist Alyssa Rhoden and colleagues have proposed that this wobble could be due to a liquid ocean moving beneath the moon’s icy surface. The researchers believe other moons should be examined to see if they too might have oceans hidden beneath their surfaces. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",

    optionD:
      "D. Research has revealed that an oddity in the rotation of Mimas could be explained by an ocean hidden beneath its surface.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The study isn’t denitive, but it says that Mimas’s wobbly rotation could be explained by the hidden ocean. Choice A is incorrect. This choice goes too far beyond the information in the text. Rhoden’s team proposed that one moon of Saturn could have a liquid ocean beneath its surface, and that other moons should also be examined, but no one has conrmed anything. Choice B is incorrect. This choice conicts with the text. Research has identied at least one sign—the unusual wobble in Mimas’s rotation—that might be due to a hidden ocean beneath its surface. Choice C is incorrect.

      "The Younger Dryas was a period of extreme cooling from 11,700 to 12,900 years ago in the Northern Hemisphere. Some scientists argue that a comet fragment hitting Earth brought about the cooling. Others disagree, partly because there is no known crater from such an impact that dates to the beginning of the period. In 2015, a team led by Kurt Kjær detected a 19-mile-wide crater beneath a glacier in Greenland. The scientists who believe an impact caused the Younger Dryas claim that this discovery supports their view. However, Kjær’s team hasn’t yet been able to determine the age of the crater. Therefore, the team suggests that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",

      "A. it can’t be concluded that the impact that made the crater was connected to the beginning of the Younger Dryas.",

    optionC:
      "C. scientists have ignored the possibility that something other than a comet fragment could have made the crater.",
    optionD:
      "D. the scientists who believe an impact caused the Younger Dryas have made incorrect assumptions about when the period began.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of a crater’s connection to the start of the Younger Dryas. According to the text, some scientists believe that a comet fragment hitting Earth caused the cooling of the Younger Dryas period to come about. The text then indicates that a team of scientists found a crater in Greenland, which some believe supports the theory of a comet fragment hitting Earth to initiate the Younger Dryas. However, the text also notes that the team was unable to determine the age of the crater. If the age of the crater can’t be determined, then its connection to the Younger Dryas period of time can’t be conrmed either. Thus, it can’t be concluded that the impact that made the crater was connected to the beginning of the Younger Dryas. Choice B is incorrect because though the text suggests that the age of the comet crater found by a team of scientists is uncertain, it doesn’t address whether a comet fragment can make a crater as large as 19 miles wide. The text doesn’t consider the size of comet fragments and how they relate to the size of craters they might make. Choice C is incorrect because the debate in the text centers on the age of the crater found, not the cause of the crater. The text doesn’t indicate uncertainty about what caused the discovered crater. Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests that the age of the crater found by the team of scientists is uncertain, not that the dates of the Younger Dryas are uncertain or incorrect. The text states that "the Younger Dryas was a period of extreme cooling from 11,700 to 12,900 years ago" but doesn’t indicate any debate about the timing of the period.',

Annie Peng Cui and Jennifer Wiggins recruited 171 participants (ages 18–60) online for an initial study and 83 students (ages 18–31) at a state university for a second study to test the effect of three different messages—“pay what you can,” “pay what you think it’s worth,” and “pay what you want”—on how much participants would pay for concert tickets.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text about the effect of messaging on participative pricing. The graph shows mean ticket prices chosen by participants in response to three messages across two studies: Study 1, which the text indicates was conducted with an age-diverse group recruited online, and Study 2, which was conducted with student participants. The graph indicates that in the "pay what you think it’s worth" condition, the mean price of the concert tickets in Study 2 was about $74, which is greater than the mean price of about $55 in Study 1. In other words, when participants were asked to consider their valuation of the tickets, the response was heterogeneous, or mixed. Moreover, according to the graph, both Study 1 and Study 2 show higher prices for the tickets under the "pay what you think it’s worth" condition than they do under both the "pay what you can" and the "pay what you want" conditions. That is, the data suggest that both groups of participants named higher prices when considering the value of the tickets than when considering either what they could afford or wanted to pay, a nding that supports the idea that sellers can benet when prompting consumers to consider their own valuations when they choose prices. Choice A is incorrect because it contradicts information in the graph. Although the graph shows that students in Study 2 assigned a higher value to the tickets than did the age-diverse group in Study 1, which would support the idea that consumer valuations were heterogeneous, the graph shows that in the "pay what you can" (i.e., what you can afford) condition, the students in Study 2 assigned a higher price (about $40), not a lower price, than the age-diverse group in Study 1 did (about $30). Moreover, even if it were true that the students had assigned a lower price in this condition, it wouldn’t support the result described in the text, only that the participants across the two studies had different ideas of what they can afford to pay. Choice B is incorrect. Although a nding that participants tended to choose prices that were closest to the actual ticket costs in the "pay what you think it’s worth" condition would support the idea that sellers benet by prompting consumers to think about their own valuations (since it’s implied that sellers would lose money in the other conditions, where chosen prices were lower than the participants’ valuations), neither the text nor the graph addresses how any of the prices chosen by the study participants relate to the tickets’ actual market price. Choice D is incorrect. Although the wide variation in participant valuations would support the idea that consumer valuations tend to be heterogeneous, neither the text nor the graph provides any information from which to discern the relative levels of variance among the responses from participants in either study.',

Regardless of the reasons, art collectives usually involve some collaboration among the artists. Based on a recent series of interviews with various art collectives, an arts journalist claims that this can be dicult for artists who are often used to having sole control over their work. Which quotation from the interviews best illustrates the journalist’s claim?",

      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the quotation that best illustrates the journalist’s claim.

    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Anita Allen’s argument about judges citing philosophers in their judicial opinions. The text indicates that judges sometimes cite philosophers when writing their judicial opinions and that, according to Allen, judges tend to cite philosophers whose views are in agreement with those of the judges themselves. Allen claims, however, that the best judicial opinions consider potential objections and rebut them, which suggests that judges may be able to strengthen their opinions by including discussions of philosophers with views contrary to their own. Choice A is incorrect because Allen’s claim is that judges could improve their judicial opinions by citing philosophers who disagree with the views expressed in the opinions, which would necessarily require judges to consult philosophical works. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no discussion in the text about making judicial opinions more easily understood by any particular group of readers. The focus of the text is on Allen’s claim that judicial opinions could be strengthened by the inclusion of discussions of philosophers whose views disagree with those of the judges authoring the opinions.

The researchers conclude that shimmering could be a specialized defense response to hornets. Choice A is incorrect. The text says that giant honeybees don’t appear to use shimmering against other, larger predators. However, it never suggests that researchers don’t know which other defenses giant honeybees do use for those predators. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that hornets are one predator of giant honeybees, but it doesn’t say that hornets are the main predator of giant honeybees. This choice also fails to mention “shimmering,” which is a major focus of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text only discusses the shimmering of giant honeybees—it doesn’t discuss other insects’ defense responses at all.",

    question:
      "Gorgets, or necklaces with large pendants, have been part of the ceremonial attire of tribes from the US Southeast for centuries. One of the oldest examples, the Faireld Gorget, was found in Faireld, Missouri, in 1958. Its overall design resembles that of other art from the region during the Mississippian period (900–1600 CE). Yet the image on the gorget is of a jaguar—a species whose range doesn’t extend to Missouri. Jaguar images are common in ancient Mexican art, and Mexico lies squarely in the species’ range. Therefore, some scholars argue that long-distance trade in Mexican art objects brought the imagery to Missouri, where a local artist could have adopted it and incorporated it into the Faireld Gorget. Which nding, if true, would most strongly support the underlined explanation?",
    optionA:
      "A. The Faireld Gorget is dated not to the Mississippian period but instead to the earlier Woodland period, which ended around 900 CE.",
    optionB:
      "B. The range of the jaguar is shown to have expanded dramatically after the Mississippian period came to a close around 1600 CE.",
    optionC:
      "C. An ancient Mexican art object is found at a site that dates to the Mississippian period and is close to where the Faireld Gorget was foun",
    optionD:
      "D. Certain works by present-day artists from Southeastern tribes reect outside cultural inuences, including contemporary Mexican art.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would most strongly support the underlined explanation that the jaguar imagery on the Faireld Gorget could have been inspired by art objects brought to Missouri from Mexico. The text describes the Faireld Gorget as one of the oldest examples of these necklaces, noting that it’s similar to other art from the Mississippian period except for its image of a jaguar. The text goes on to explain that this is unusual because the jaguar’s range didn’t include Missouri. The Faireld Gorget’s artist likely wouldn’t have encountered a live jaguar, but since such jaguar images were common in ancient Mexican art (and the jaguar’s range did include Mexico), perhaps some of that art inspired the gorget’s artist. Therefore, evidence that an ancient Mexican art object had been found at a site that was close to the Faireld Gorget in both location and time period would strongly support the explanation that long-distance trade from Mexico took place during the Mississippian period and that jaguar imagery could have reached Missouri by those means. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined explanation indicates that Mexican artistic inuence preceded the creation of the Faireld Gorget. An artifact from Mexico that appeared in Missouri only after the gorget was created cannot support such a claim. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to whether the jaguar image on the Faireld Gorget was suggested to the Mississippian artist who made it by encounters with depictions of jaguars in Mexican art. The appearance of jaguars in Missouri after the Mississippian period cannot provide evidence for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to inuence that Mexican art might have had on Mississippian art, restricted to the period from 900 CE to 1600 CE. The actions of contemporary artists cannot provide evidence for centuries-old networks of artistic inuence and exchange.",

      "Georgia Douglas Johnson wrote many plays in the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, professional theater companies rarely put on plays by Black women, so few of Johnson’s plays made it to the stage. Only a small number of her plays were published in her lifetime. But that doesn’t mean that Johnson never learned what other people thought of her plays. Johnson hosted weekly get-togethers for fellow Black writers and artists in her Washington, D.C., home. Attendees would read and discuss one another’s work, including Johnson’s own. These gatherings could therefore serve as ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",

This suggests that the gatherings could provide an opportunity for Johnson to get feedback on her plays. Notice how the text foreshadows this conclusion by the mention of Johnson learning "what other people thought of her plays." Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention theater companies attending the get-togethers, so there is no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention learning about plays from other cities, so there is no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect.

    optionD:
      "D. James Young Deer actually directed 33 lms and acted in only 10.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it uses data from the table to effectively exemplify the idea that the lm outputs of the four individuals included in the table should be considered bare minimums—that is, that we should assume that the individuals actually had higher outputs than those recorded. The table presents the years during which the individuals were active and the number of known lms the individuals are credited in. The table indicates that Lillian St. Cyr has 66 lm credits as an actor and that Edwin Carewe has 58 lm credits as a director; it follows that if some lms and records for the era were lost, it’s possible that Lillian St. Cyr acted in far more than 66 lms and that Edwin Carewe directed more than 58 lms. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn’t effectively exemplify the idea that the lm outputs of the four individuals included in the table should be considered bare minimums. Rather than addressing the idea that the individuals likely had higher outputs than those presented in the table, this choice simply compares data from the table to make the point that Dark Cloud has fewer credited acting roles than Lillian St. Cyr (35 and 66, respectively). Choice B is incorrect because it misrepresents data from the table, even though it may exemplify the idea that the lm outputs of the four individuals included in the table should be considered bare minimums by implying that Edwin Carewe acted in more than 47 lms. The table indicates that Edwin Carewe was active from 1912 to 1934, meaning that his 47 credited acting roles were in lms made before or during 1934, not after that time. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t effectively exemplify the idea that the lm outputs of the four individuals included in the table should be considered bare minimums. Instead of addressing the idea that the individuals likely had higher outputs than those recorded, this choice suggests that James Young Deer actually acted in and directed fewer lms than presented in the table (only 33 known lms as a director instead of 35, and only 10 known lms as an actor instead of 33).",

Ke Dong and her team found that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-ower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating just one odor receptor—and this receptor, Or31, is present in all mosquito species known to carry diseases. Therefore, the researchers suggest that in developing new repellents, it would be most useful to ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. identify molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors.",

    optionD:
      "D. determine the maximum number of different odor receptors that can be activated by a single molecule.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of mosquito repellents. The text begins by explaining that many repellents work by using natural components to active multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes’ antennae, and that new repellents must be created whenever mosquitoes become resistant to older ones. The text then highlights a research team’s discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-ower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are dicult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing ecient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, since that component targets the Or31 odor receptor shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that researchers are unaware of the precise location of Or31 and other odor receptors in mosquitoes’ antennae or that knowing this information would be useful for developing ecient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, which targets the Or31 odor receptor. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should instead search for additional molecular components that, like EBF, activate the one odor receptor that is known to be shared by all diseasebearing mosquitoes.",

    optionD: "D. the spawning frequency of",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of articial light at night (ALAN) and the common clownsh (A. ocellaris). The text indicates that researchers found that when A. ocellaris is exposed to low levels of ALAN, spawning frequency and egg fertilization aren’t signicantly affected but hatching is completely inhibited—that is, the eggs never hatch. Therefore, if A. ocellaris were to settle only in regions where the sh would be regularly exposed to low levels of ALAN, their eggs would stop hatching and their reproductive success would be at risk. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that exposure to low levels of ALAN had no signicant effect on egg fertilization for A. ocellaris, so there’s no reason to expect there would be any signicant difference in rates of successful egg fertilization between areas with low levels of ALAN and areas without ALAN. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss the particular effects of low levels of ALAN on any species of coral reef sh besides A. ocellaris. For this reason, there’s no support in the text for the idea that the reproductive success of A. ocellaris is more greatly affected by the presence of low levels of ALAN than the reproductive success of other species of coral reef sh is. Choice D is incorrect. The text does indicate that A. ocellaris incubation was most strongly affected by low levels of ALAN, but it doesn’t indicate that there was a greater effect on spawning frequency than on egg fertilization; in fact, the text states that there was no signicant effect on either.",

The text describes a student advancing the claim that Chambi’s photographs “have considerable ethnographic value”—meaning that they are valuable as records of cultures—and that they “capture diverse elements of Peruvian society” in a respectful way. If it’s true that Chambi carefully photographed people from a range of different communities in Peru as well as photographed the customs and sites of different communities, that would lend support to the claim that the photographs have ethnographic value as depictions of diverse elements of society in Peru. Choice B is incorrect because the student’s claim is that Chambi’s photographs have considerable ethnographic value because they depict diverse elements of Peruvian society; the student doesn’t claim anything about the technical skill demonstrated in the photographs. Choice C is incorrect because neither Chambi’s reputation nor the locations where his photographs may have been published would be relevant to the student’s claim that his photographs are valuable as an ethnographic record of Peru’s diverse society.

In a study addressing this relative ineciency, a team led by Laura Miranda-Pérez demonstrated that the addition of a thin layer of the mineral perovskite—which captures the blue range of light in the solar spectrum, whereas silicon captures the red range—allows the cells to convert 29.5% or more of the Sun’s energy into usable electricity.

    optionD:
      "D. researchers need to evaluate whether other minerals like perovskite are as effective as perovskite seems to be.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the eciency of various photovoltaic cells. The text indicates that Miranda-Pérez and her team found that adding a layer of perovskite to silicon-based cells increased the percentage of sunlight converted to usable electricity relative to the percentage converted to electricity by silicon-based cells. Using cells with only perovskite and no silicon, however, resulted in no improvement in eciency over silicon-based cells. The text also states that perovskite captures light in the blue range of the solar spectrum and silicon captures light in the red range of the spectrum. If perovskite and silicon capture different parts of the solar spectrum and the combination of perovskite and silicon results in greater eciency than the use of either perovskite or silicon alone does, then it is reasonable to infer that the improved eciency of perovskite-silicon cells could be attributable to their making use of more of the solar spectrum than perovskite-based or silicon-based cells do. Choice B is incorrect because it is directly contradicted by the text, which says that silicon-based cells convert 18%–22% of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity and that cells with only perovskite are no more ecient than silicon-based cells are. Perovskite-only cells thus must convert 22% or less—not more than 29.5%—of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on a possible improvement to photovoltaic cells and makes no mention of any alternatives to those cells, so there is no reason to conclude that photovoltaic cells must be replaced with some other technology. Additionally, the text presents solar power as something that currently exists, so it wouldn’t make sense to conclude that solar power will remain elusive. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of other minerals than perovskite. In fact, the text gives no indication that it is even possible to use other minerals than silicon and perovskite in photovoltaic cells. Instead, the text is focused on the effect of combining perovskite and silicon and the different parts of the solar spectrum that perovskite and silicon capture.",

      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the discovered ship. The text states that much of the ship’s wooden hull was found in a quarry. The text also states that wood rots quickly unless it is protected by sediment, which shields the wood from exposure to oxygen. It is therefore reasonable to infer that the surviving portion of the ship’s hull was covered by an oxygen-shielding layer of sediment.

Choice C is incorrect because the text does not address the type of wood used in sixteenth-century ships or any theories pertaining to wood choice in ships. Choice D is incorrect because the text states only that the ship is from the sixteenth century, with no other dates offered for its construction, and thus there is no basis to consider alternative ages for the ship.

    optionD:
      "D. The number of wild California condors increased overall from 2014 to 2020 and exceeded the number of those living in captivity.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the biologists’ claim. The text accompanying the graph describes the efforts of the California Condor Recovery Program, which is working to protect the condor from extinction. The program captured some condors in 1987 in order to breed them and has been reintroducing captive birds into the wild since 1992. Many biologists claim the program has been a success, as the text explains, and it is reasonable to infer that an indication of the program’s success would be an increase in the wild condor population compared to the captive condor population. The graph shows the wild and captive condor populations in California between 2014 and 2020. In 2014 there were slightly more than 200 wild condors in California, but by 2020 there were more than 300. Meanwhile, over the same period the captive condor population remained under 200. Thus, the biologists’ claim about the program’s success is supported by data from the graph showing that the number of wild California condors increased overall from 2014 to 2020 and exceeded the number of those living in captivity. Choice A is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The number of captive California condors did not steadily decrease between 2014 and 2020: rather, it increased slightly during some years and decreased slightly during others, generally remaining at slightly less than 200. Choice B is incorrect. Even though the graph does show a slight decrease in both the captive and wild condor populations from 2019 to 2020, such a decrease during a particular year would not demonstrate the program’s success. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The difference between the number of captive and wild California condors did not remain relatively steady between 2014 and 2017. While the number of captive condors remained roughly the same during that period, the number of wild condors increased, so the difference between the number of captive and wild condors increased as well.",

    question:
      "If an animal has been extinct for a long time, how can scientists learn what color it was? One group of scientists came up with a possible answer. When the scientists examined the fossilized feather of an extinct bird, they found melanosomes in it. Melanosomes produce pigment, or grains of color, inside cells. Because melanosomes are shaped differently depending on which colors they produce, the scientists hypothesized that they could ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. show how melanosomes can be found in fossils belonging to animals from other extinct species.",
    optionB:
      "B. determine the colors of the bird based on the appearance of the melanosomes in the feather.",
    optionC:
      "C. explain why the melanosomes in the feather were so well preserve",
    optionD:
      "D. identify the colors of extinct animals whose fossils lack melanosomes.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of a hypothesis by one group of scientists about how to determine the colors of a long-extinct animal. The text explains that the scientists found melanosomes in the fossilized feather of an extinct bird and that melanosomes are responsible for producing color inside cells. The text also explains that melanosomes have different shapes depending on the colors they produce. Given this information, it follows that the scientists hypothesized that they could determine the colors of the extinct bird by examining the shapes of the melanosomes in the feather. Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that the scientists were seeking to show how melanosomes can be found in fossils belonging to animals from other extinct species. Rather, the text indicates that the scientists were seeking to identify an extinct bird’s colors, and the text strongly suggests that the scientists hypothesized that they could achieve their goal by examining the shapes of the melanosomes in the bird’s fossilized feather. Choice C is incorrect because the text never suggests that the scientists were seeking to explain why the melanosomes in the feather were so well preserved. Rather, the text indicates that the scientists were seeking to identify an extinct bird’s colors, and the text strongly suggests that the scientists hypothesized that they could achieve their goal by examining the shapes of the melanosomes in the bird’s fossilized feather. Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests only one method of identifying the colors of extinct animals: by examining the shapes of melanosomes found in fossils. The text doesn’t discuss other methods for learning the colors of extinct animals and therefore provides no support for the idea that the scientists could identify the colors of extinct animals whose fossils lack melanosomes.",

Tests of attentiveness were administered to participants three times during the study: at random for the no-leave staff, and for the rest, one week before their leave, one week following their return to work, and one week after the second test administration.

    optionD:
      "D. In the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Jan Packer and colleagues’ conclusion about the effect of leave time on the attentiveness of university employees. According to the text, the researchers’ study design included a group of employees who took no leave, a group who took 2–4 days of leave, and a group who took 1–5 weeks of leave. The participants who took leave were tested for attentiveness one week before their leave (the rst test administration), one week after their return to work (the second test administration), and two weeks after their return (the third test administration). The participants who took no leave were tested three times at random. The graph shows that at one week after their return to work, participants who took only 2–4 days of leave had an average attentiveness score of between 540 and 600, while participants who took 1–5 weeks of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540. At two weeks after their return to work, those who took only 2–4 days of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540, while those who took 1–5 weeks of leave had an average score of approximately 480. In other words, the graph shows that on both post-leave testing dates, participants with longer leave times had lower average attentiveness scores than those with shorter leave times. Since attentiveness is an indicator of cognitive functioning, these data conrm Packer and colleagues’ conclusion that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benet than shorter leave times do. Choice A is incorrect. The graph does show that in the second test administration, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave and also shows that in the third test administration, those who took no leave had higher average scores than those who took 1–5 weeks of leave. But neither of these ndings has a direct bearing on the researchers’ conclusion, which concerns a comparison of participants who took 2–4 days of leave with those who took 1–5 weeks, rather than a comparison of either group with participants who took no leave. Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the rst test administration, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1–5 weeks of leave and those who took no leave, this test administration occurred before any participants went on leave; therefore, these results have no bearing on the researchers’ conclusion about how the amount of leave taken by participants affected their cognitive functioning. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, the researchers’ conclusion is about the effects of short leave compared with the effects of long leave, not the effects of short leave compared with the effects of no leave. These results are therefore irrelevant to the conclusion.",

      "Average Number and Duration of Torpor Bouts and Arousal Episodes for Alaska Marmots and Arctic Ground Squirrels, 2008–2011 Feature Alaska marmots Arctic ground squirrels torpor bouts 12 10.5 duration per bout 13.81 days 16.77 days arousal episodes 11 9.5 duration per episode 21.2 hours 14.2 hours When hibernating, Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels enter a state called torpor, which minimizes the energy their bodies need to function. Often a hibernating animal will temporarily come out of torpor (called an arousal episode) and its metabolic rate will rise, burning more of the precious energy the animal needs to survive the winter. Alaska marmots hibernate in groups and therefore burn less energy keeping warm during these episodes than they would if they were alone. A researcher hypothesized that because Arctic ground squirrels hibernate alone, they would likely exhibit longer bouts of torpor and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots. Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researcher’s hypothesis?",
    optionA:
      "A. The Alaska marmots’ arousal episodes lasted for days, while the Arctic ground squirrels’ arousal episodes lasted less than a day.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it describes data from the table that support the researcher’s hypothesis. According to the text, the researcher hypothesized that Arctic ground squirrels would exhibit longer torpor bouts and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots do—or, put the other way, that the marmots would show shorter torpor bouts and longer arousal episodes than the ground squirrels do. The table shows data about torpor bouts and arousal episodes for the two species from 2008 to 2011. According to the table, the average duration of torpor bouts was 13.81 days for Alaska marmots, shorter than the average of 16.77 days for Arctic ground squirrels, and the average duration of arousal episodes was 21.2 hours for Alaska marmots, longer than the average of 14.2 hours for Arctic ground squirrels. Thus, the table supports the researcher’s hypothesis by showing that Alaska marmots had shorter bouts of torpor and longer arousal episodes than Arctic ground squirrels did. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table and doesn’t support the researcher’s hypothesis. The table shows that the average duration of arousal episodes was less than a day for both Alaska marmots (21.2 hours) and Arctic ground squirrels (14.2 hours). Additionally, information about arousal episodes for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels isn’t sucient to support a hypothesis involving comparisons of both arousal episodes and torpor bouts for those animals. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t support the researcher’s hypothesis, which involves comparisons of arousal episodes as well as torpor bouts for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels. Noting that both animals had torpor bouts lasting several days, on average, doesn’t address arousal episodes at all, nor does it reveal how the animals’ torpor bouts compared. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t support the researcher’s hypothesis. Although the table does show that Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts (12) than arousal episodes (11) and that their arousal episodes were much shorter than their torpor bouts (21.2 hours and 13.81 days, respectively), comparing data across only Alaska marmot behaviors isn’t sucient to support a hypothesis about torpor and arousal behaviors of both Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels.",

      "D. “Reading [poetry], however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers that there is in / it after all, a place for the genuine.”",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from "Poetry" to illustrate the claim that the poem highlights an ambivalence, or a conicted attitude, toward poetry. In the quotation, the speaker suggests that one might read poetry with "contempt," or disdain, for it, but even with this negative attitude one will nd "a place for the genuine." Because the quotation expresses conicting attitudes toward poetry, it effectively illustrates the speaker’s ambivalence in discussing the merits and displeasure of reading poetry. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn’t mention poetry or show ambivalence. Choice B is incorrect. Although the idea of "half poets" may seem to relate to ambivalence, the speaker mentions only negative attitudes toward certain works and the quotation therefore lacks a contrasting positive or neutral attitude that would be needed to indicate ambivalence. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker mentions only negative attitudes toward certain works and the quotation therefore lacks a contrasting positive or neutral attitude that would be needed to indicate ambivalence.',

      "Choice A is the best answer. Females only traveled 9.28 km per day in the cold-dry season, versus 12.64 and 12.48 km per day in the monsoon and hot-dry seasons, respectively. Males only traveled 15.81 km per day per day in the cold-dry season, versus 18.93 and 18.87 km per day in the monsoon and hot-dry seasons, respectively. So, the cold-dry season was the season where both males and females had the least daily travel. Choice B is incorrect. Although females traveled least in the cold-dry season, males didn’t travel least in the hot-dry season. Instead, they traveled less per day in the cold-dry season as well. Choice C is incorrect.

      "A student performs an experiment testing her hypothesis that a slightly acidic soil environment is more benecial for the growth of the plant Brassica rapa parachinensis (a vegetable commonly known as choy sum) than a neutral soil environment. She plants sixteen seeds of choy sum in a mixture of equal amounts of coffee grounds (which are highly acidic) and potting soil and another sixteen seeds in potting soil without coffee grounds as the control for the experiment. The two groups of seeds were exposed to the same growing conditions and monitored for three weeks. Which nding, if true, would most directly weaken the student’s hypothesis?",

    optionD:
      "D. Signicantly fewer of the choy sum seeds planted in the soil without coffee grounds sprouted plants than did the seeds planted in the mixture of soil and coffee\ngrounds.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it describes an experimental outcome that would most directly weaken the student’s hypothesis. According to the text, the student hypothesizes that Brassica rapa parachinensis (choy sum) will benet more from acidic soil than it will from neutral soil. The text then explains that the student planted 16 choy sum seeds in potting soil with coffee grounds added to increase acidity and another 16 seeds in soil without coffee grounds as a control (a group identical to the experimental group except for the experimental modication being tested). If the hypothesis were correct, the plants in the more acidic soiland-coffee-grounds mixture would grow faster than those in the control group. However, choice A proposes a scenario in which the plants in soil without coffee grounds were “signicantly taller” than those in the more acidic mixture—an outcome that weakens the hypothesis that higher acidity is benecial to the plants’ growth. Choice B is incorrect. If the choy sum planted in the neutral soil produced less plant matter and therefore weighed less than the choy sum planted in the acidic soiland-coffee-grounds mixture, this nding would strengthen the student’s hypothesis, not weaken it. Choice C is incorrect. If seeds planted in neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted signicantly later than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture, this nding would strengthen, not weaken, the student’s hypothesis that acidic soil benets choy sum. Choice D is incorrect. If seeds planted in the neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted signicantly fewer plants than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture did, this nding would strengthen, not weaken, the student’s hypothesis that choy sum benets from acidic soil.",

    question:
      "Initially observed in 2017, the interstellar object ‘Oumuamua is the rst object of its kind to be seen in our solar system. Researchers have been puzzled because its acceleration cannot be entirely explained by the gravitational pull of nearby bodies: there must be a nongravitational inuence on its velocity and trajectory. Some previously suggested explanations for this nongravitational acceleration involve mechanisms that are unlikely or unrealistic, such as geometric effects from ‘Oumuamua being potentially composed of several spatially separated bodies. Now, Jennifer Bergner and colleagues propose that the nongravitational acceleration is due to the gaseous expulsion of entrapped hydrogen from ‘Oumuamua’s water-rich icy body. Which statement, if true, would most strongly support the claim made by Bergner and colleagues about the cause of ‘Oumuamua’s acceleration?",
    optionA: "A. ",
    optionB:
      "B. ‘Oumuamua’s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration that would be caused by the release of hydrogen gas resulting from the processing\nof water ice (H O), but the interstellar object’s observable properties can be explained if it has a signicant component of molecular hydrogen ice (H ).",
    optionC:
      "C. Since nongravitational accelerations of interstellar objects are several orders of magnitude weaker than gravitational accelerations, deviation from behavior that\ncould be fully attributed to gravitational pull has been detected on a limited number of objects similar to ‘Oumuamu",
    optionD:
      "D. Exposure to interstellar cosmic radiation can result in the formation of embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice; moreover, when traveling through the\nsolar system, ‘Oumuamua experienced warming sucient to alter its icy structure and allow for outgassing.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents ndings that, if true, would support the claim made by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of ‘Oumuamua is due to the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen. The text rst introduces the observation of a unique interstellar object named ‘Oumuamua and goes on to explain that the object exhibited nongravitational acceleration that could not be fully attributed to the expected cause: gravitational pull of nearby celestial bodies. The text concludes by stating that Bergner and colleagues claim that the nongravitational acceleration is caused by expulsion of hydrogen gas from ‘Oumuamua’s water-rich icy body. To support this claim requires evidence that hydrogen gas could be present within ‘Oumuamua at all, which this answer choice presents: cosmic radiation can result in embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice. Additionally, evidence that this gas can be released from such a body is required to fully support the claim, which this answer choice goes on to provide: ‘Oumuamua experienced sucient warming as it traveled through the solar system to alter its icy structure and release the hydrogen gas. Thus, this answer choice provides the best evidence to support Bergner and colleagues’ claim. Choice A is incorrect because this answer choice concerns faults with previous models of outgassing from ‘Oumuamua of carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which would not support a claim regarding hydrogen outgassing. Furthermore, inconsistencies in other models would not provide evidence in support of a different model or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. The evidence presented in this answer choice would weaken the claim proposed by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of ‘Oumuamua is caused by the expulsion of hydrogen gas because this answer choice suggests that there is evidence that refutes this claim: ‘Oumuamua’s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration caused by the release of hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the remaining portion of this answer choice is unrelated to the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the claim being made by Bergner and colleagues concerns the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen gas, but this answer choice is concerned solely with the differences in magnitude of gravitational and nongravitational acceleration, which would not support Bergner’s claim. Furthermore, this answer choice discusses interstellar objects similar to ‘Oumuamua, but the text states that ‘Oumuamua is the rst observed object of its kind in our solar system, so evidence from other, similar bodies would not be available.",

Given that the example is presented in support of the idea that more people selected curtailments than eciencies, the most effective way to complete the example is not by referring to another curtailment but rather by referring to an eciency that was selected by a relatively low percentage of respondents.",

    question:
      "The ice melted on a Norwegian mountain during a particularly warm summer in 2019, revealing a 1,700-year-old sandal to a mountaineer looking for artifacts. The sandal would normally have degraded quickly, but it was instead well preserved for centuries by the surrounding ice. According to archaeologist Espen Finstad and his team, the sandal, like those worn by imperial Romans, wouldn’t have offered any protection from the cold in the mountains, so some kind of insulation, like fabric or animal skin, would have needed to be worn on the feet with the sandal. What does the text indicate about the discovery of the sandal?",
    optionA:
      "A. Temperatures contributed to both protecting and revealing the sandal.",
    optionB:
      "B. The discovery revealed that the Roman Empire had more inuence on Norway than archaeologists previously assume",
    optionC: "C. ",
    optionD:
      "D. The sandal would have degraded if it hadn’t been removed from the ice.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. A "particularly warm summer" revealed the sandal, and centuries of ice kept it "well preserved." Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t reect the information in the text. The sandal is similar to Roman sandals, but there is no indication that it was a result of Roman inuence. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t support this choice. We don’t have enough information to know whether or not archaeologists would have found the sandal without people like the treasure-hunting mountaineer. Choice D is incorrect. The text says the opposite of this choice. The sandal was preserved by the ice for centuries.',

    question:
      "Alice Guy-Blaché directed hundreds of lms between 1896 and 1920. She wanted audiences to feel like they were watching real people on screen. She would encourage actors in her lms to behave naturally. Guy-Blaché even hung a large sign reading “Be Natural” in the studio where she made her lms. At the time, lms lacked sound, so actors needed to rely solely on their bodies and facial expressions to convey emotions. As a result, actors tended to highly exaggerate their actions and expressions. The style of acting in Guy-Blaché’s lms was therefore ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA: "A. copied by many of Guy-Blaché’s peers.",
    optionB: "B. familiar to actors who had worked on other directors’ lms.",
    optionC: "C. very unusual for the perio",
    optionD: "D. better than lm acting today.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. The text tells us that “actors tended to highly exaggerate their actions and expressions” in lms produced from 1896 to 1920. This suggests that the natural style of acting in Guy-Blaché’s lms was very unusual for the time. Choice A is incorrect. The text never discusses any other directors copying the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché’s lms, and in fact suggests the opposite—that it was unusual for directors to suggest this style of acting at the time. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses actors’ familiarity with the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché’s lms, so there isn’t much basis for this inference. But since the text tells us that other lms of the period used a highly exaggerated form of acting, we might predict that the natural style in Guy-Blachés lms would have been unfamiliar to these actors. Choice D is incorrect. The text never discusses lm acting today, so there’s no basis for this inference.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of volunteering. The text asserts that volunteering benets both the community in which one volunteers and society as a whole. It then states that in a survey of young people, a majority of respondents said that volunteering helps individuals, but only 6% of respondents said that volunteering helps society as a whole. If volunteering does in fact help society as a whole, as the text says, but only 6% of young people believe it does, then it’s reasonable to conclude that volunteering is more helpful than many young people think it is. Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses young people’s beliefs about the benets of volunteering, not where young people believe they are able to volunteer. Nothing in the text suggests that many young people believe they are only able to volunteer in their own communities. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that volunteering is benecial for society as a whole, nothing in the text suggests that volunteering can benet society more than it can benet individual people. The text doesn’t compare the benets to society with the benets to individuals. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses young people’s beliefs about the benets of volunteering, not how to nd volunteering opportunities.

      "Tides can deposit large quantities of dead vegetation within a salt marsh, smothering healthy plants and leaving a salt panne—a depression devoid of plants that tends to trap standing water—in the marsh’s interior. Ecologist Kathryn Beheshti and colleagues found that burrowing crabs living within these pannes improve drainage by loosening the soil, leading the pannes to shrink as marsh plants move back in. At salt marsh edges, however, crab-induced soil loosening can promote marsh loss by accelerating erosion, suggesting that the burrowing action of crabs ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. can be benecial to marshes with small pannes but can be harmful to marshes with large pannes.",

      "D. varies in intensity depending on the size of the panne relative to the size of the surrounding marsh.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. The text says that crab burrowing in the pannes enables plants to grow there again. It also says that crab burrowing at the edges of the marsh speeds up marsh loss. This suggests that burrowing crabs can either help or hurt marshes, depending on where they’re located. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses pannes of different sizes. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never suggests that crabs do more burrowing in the pannes (the areas with standing water) than they do at the edges. Rather, the text says that the burrowing that happens in the pannes is benecial, while the burrowing that happens at the edges is harmful. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported.

Ibáñez and colleagues modeled the radial growth of the trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate scenarios (the current climate, moderate change, and extreme change).

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Ibáñez and colleagues’ conclusion that increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition can compensate for the negative effect of climate change on tree growth if that change is moderate but not if it’s extreme. The bar graph shows the growth of sugar maple trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate-change scenarios: current conditions, a moderate change, and an extreme change. According to the graph, radial growth without nitrogen fertilization is projected to be about 0.16 centimeters (cm) under current conditions, 0.15 cm under a moderate change, and 0.04 cm under an extreme change. The graph also shows that with nitrogen fertilization, growth is projected to be about 0.18 centimeters under a moderate change but only about 0.06 centimeters under an extreme change. Thus, the data in the graph support the researchers’ conclusion by showing greater growth for a moderate change using nitrogen fertilization than they do either under current conditions without nitrogen fertilization or under an extreme change with nitrogen fertilization. Choice A is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn’t support Ibáñez and colleagues’ conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of anthropogenic nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it’s extreme. To support this would require comparing radial growth without nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under both moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth with nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions and moderate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under an extreme change, which don’t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice B is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn’t support Ibáñez and colleagues’ conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it’s extreme. The support needed would compare radial growth under current climate conditions without nitrogen fertilization to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth without nitrogen fertilization under current conditions and moderate change and growth with nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don’t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice C is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn’t support Ibáñez and colleagues’ conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it’s extreme.

The researchers calculated that if individual plants were randomly distributed on this particular landscape, only about 15% would be with other plants in patches of vegetation. They counted the number of juvenile plants of ve species growing in patches of vegetation and the number growing alone on bare ground and compared those numbers to what would be expected if the plants were randomly distributed. Based on these results, they claim that plants of these species that grow in close proximity to other plants gain an advantage at an early developmental stage.

      "D. Assessment\nSAT\nTest\nReading and Writing\nDomain\nInformation and\nIdeas\nSkill\nCommand of\nEvidence\nDiculty",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. The table shows the total number of juvenile plants from ve species that were found growing on bare ground and in patches of vegetation as well as the percentage of the total number of each species that were growing in patches of vegetation. For each of the ve species, more than 50% of the juvenile plants were growing in patches of vegetation. The text notes, however, that a random distribution of plants across the landscape should result in only about 15% of the plants being found in patches of vegetation. In other words, for each of the ve species, the percentage of juvenile plants found growing in patches of vegetation was substantially higher than could be explained by chance alone. This nding supports the claim in the text: if plants growing in patches are overrepresented among plants that have survived to the juvenile stage, as the data show they are, then it suggests that it’s advantageous for plants at an early stage of development to grow in patches of vegetation. Choice A is incorrect because the statement that less than 75% of juvenile plants were found growing in patches of vegetation, while true, doesn’t clearly support the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. Saying that less than 75% of plants were found in patches doesn’t indicate how the percentage growing in patches compares with the percentage that would be expected to grow in patches on the basis of chance alone, which is the information necessary to evaluate whether the claim in the text has support in the table. Put another way, if the percentage of plants found growing in patches was 15% or less, it would be true that less than 75% were found in patches, but the data would in fact weaken the claim in the text, not strengthen it, since the data would show that growing in patches wasn’t advantageous. Choice B is incorrect because only 12 plants of this species were found growing in patches, which was the lowest number of any species, not the greatest number. Additionally, even if it were true that this species had the greatest number of plants growing in patches, the nding would be irrelevant to the claim that plants of all ve species gained an advantage by growing in close proximity to other plants. Choice C is incorrect because 59.1% of the plants of these species were found growing in patches, which is a far greater percentage, not a lower percentage, than what would be expected if plants were randomly distributed (around 15%). Additionally, if it were true that the percentage of plants growing in patches was lower for these species than what would be expected from chance alone, that nding would weaken, not strengthen, the claim that growing in patches is advantageous.",

    optionD: "D. zines are good sources of mainstream culture.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically follows from the text’s point about zines today. The text describes zines as a form of expression that goes back to the 1920s and asserts that "this old form persists." The text then indicates that multiple zines exist in the US today and that they are popular enough to support annual festivals, a point that suggests that people continue to view zines as a meaningful form of expression. Choice A is incorrect because the text’s point about current interest in zines in the US doesn’t logically suggest that zine creators can reach a larger audience by posting online. The text indicates that zines have long had an audience, and there’s no indication that online posts have caused that audience to grow; there’s no mention of zine creators’ use of the internet at all. Choice C is incorrect because the idea that zine creators can explore new art forms—while objectively true—isn’t logically connected to the text’s discussion of zines as an existing form of expression (one that often includes art) or the point that zines are still popular enough in the US to support annual festivals. Choice D is incorrect because the point that zines are popular enough in the US today to support annual festivals doesn’t logically suggest that zines present mainstream culture (or are themselves mainstream); moreover, the text states that zine creators often "challenge mainstream culture."',

Grimes wanted the poems in One Last Word to honor important Black poets of the past, so she chose lines by poets such as Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson. Writing in this way can be challenging and might seem as though it would produce awkward poems. However, reviewers praised One Last Word as a beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it. This reaction suggests that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",

    optionC:
      "C. Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson are two of Grimes’s favorite poets.",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Nikki Grimes’s poetry collection One Last Word. The text explains that Grimes used a writing method called the golden shovel to create the poems in her book. According to the text, the method involves basing a new poem on a line from an existing poem. The text then mentions Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson as examples of important Black poets whose lines of poetry form the basis of Grimes’s poems. The text goes on to say that this writing method is dicult and that the resulting poems can be awkward, but reviewers have positively reviewed Grimes’s book. If the reviewers of One Last Word specically note that the work is a “beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it,” then they must have appreciated how Grimes used the golden shovel method to pay tribute to other poets. This suggests that Grimes was successful in using the golden shovel method to achieve her goal of honoring Black poets in her book. Choice A is incorrect because the reaction suggests that most reviewers did understand Grimes’s goal for her book. According to the text, the reviewers noted that the poems in her book were a “beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it.” Earlier, the text claims that Grimes intended the poems “to honor important Black poets of the past,” so in their praise of her book, the reviewers clearly indicated that they understood Grimes’s goal. Choice C is incorrect. Although it’s likely that Grimes sought to honor Hughes and Johnson in her book of poetry because they’re among her favorite poets, this fact isn’t suggested by the reviewers’ positive reaction to her book. Instead, the reaction suggests that Grimes was successful in her use of the golden shovel method. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss whether other writers were inspired by Grimes to use the golden shovel method in their poetry. The text mentions the poets Hughes and Johnson as examples of poets honored in Grimes’s book and describes reviewers’ positive reception of her book, but it doesn’t detail Grimes’s impact on other writers.",

      "Although most songbirds build open, cupped nests, some species build domed nests with roofs that provide much more protection. Many ecologists have assumed that domed nests would provide protection from weather conditions and thus would allow species that build them to have larger geographic ranges than species that build open nests do. To evaluate this assumption, a research team led by evolutionary biologist Iliana Medina analyzed data for over 3,000 species of songbirds. Which nding from Medina and her colleagues’ study, if true, would most directly challenge the assumption in the underlined sentence?",

    optionD:
      "D. Species that build open nests tend to have larger ranges than species that build domed nests.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would challenge the assumption that many ecologists have made about the connection between the building of domed nests and geographic range in songbirds. The text says that many ecologists have assumed that since domed nests provide protection from weather conditions, songbird species that build such nests should be able to have larger geographic ranges than songbird species that build open nests do. If Medina and her colleagues found that species that build open nests tend to have larger geographic ranges than species that build domed nests do, their nding would show the opposite of what the ecologists have assumed. It would therefore challenge the ecologists’ assumption. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there’s a relationship between songbird species’ extinction rates and their geographic ranges. The nding that species that build open nests tend to have higher extinction rates than species that build domed nests do would therefore have no clear bearing on the ecologists’ assumption that domed nests allow species that build them to have larger geographic ranges than those of species that build open nests. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there’s a relationship between songbird species’ sizes and their geographic ranges. The nding that species that build open nests tend to be smaller in size than species that build domed nests are would therefore have no clear bearing on the ecologists’ assumption that domed nests allow species that build them to have larger geographic ranges than those of species that build open nests. Choice C is incorrect because although the text indicates that many ecologists have assumed that there’s a connection between how songbird species build their nests and the species’ geographic ranges, the text says that this assumption is based on the shape of the nests—that is, whether the nests are domed or open—not the number of materials used. The nding that species that build open nests tend to use fewer materials to build their nests than species that build domed nests do would therefore have no clear bearing on the ecologists’ assumption that domed nests allow species that build them to have larger geographic ranges than those of species that build open nests.",

    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the Arabia Terra region of Mars. According to the text, there are craters in Arabia Terra that could be the result of volcanic activity, and researchers have found evidence of ash deposits consistent with a large eruption. The text goes on to note, however, that erosion and other events could have altered the surface of Mars. This observation suggests that current conditions on Mars’s surface are not necessarily a reliable guide to past events—some signs of past events could have been transformed or erased entirely—and thus the current makeup of Arabia Terra may not accurately reect past volcanic activity. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests only that past events could have changed Mars’s surface such that its current appearance isn’t a reliable guide to past activity, not that it’s likely that past eruptions were not as massive as astronomers previously believed. Nothing in the text supports a conclusion about the likely size of past eruptions. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that resurfacing events could have changed the appearance of Mars doesn’t imply that the ash discussed in the text likely came from multiple volcanoes. Although it’s possible that the ash came from different volcanoes, there’s no information in the text supporting a conclusion about how likely that possibility is. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Arabia Terra craters had to have been created by something other than volcanic eruptions. Although the text does suggest that the evidence consistent with volcanic eruptions shouldn’t be taken as denitive proof of past eruptions, that doesn’t mean that the craters couldn’t have been created by eruptions, only that we can’t be certain they were.",

      "In a study of new technology adoption, Davit Marikyan et al. examined negative disconrmation (which occurs when experiences fall short of one’s expectations) to determine whether it could lead to positive outcomes for users. The team focused on established users of “smart home” technology, which presents inherent utilization challenges but tends to attract users with high expectations, often leading to feelings of dissonance. The researchers found that many users employed cognitive mechanisms to mitigate those feelings, ultimately reversing their initial sense of disappointment. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Research suggests that most users of smart home technology will not achieve a feeling of satisfaction given the utilization challenges of such technology.",

    question:
      "The ancient Sumerian civilization formed around 4000 BCE between two large rivers in an area that is now Iraq and Syria. The extremely hot and sunny weather in that area helped crops grow very quickly, but it also made it hard to keep the crops from drying up and dying. So, the Sumerians used water from the rivers in their farming. That method worked so well that they often could harvest even more crops than they needed in a season. As a result, the Sumerians ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA: "A. harvested crops only on the hottest days of each season.",
    optionB: "B. found ways to shield their crops from the sun.",
    optionC: "C. did not begin farming until long after 4000 BCE.",
    optionD: "D. were able to store extra crops for later use.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of Sumerian civilization and crop growth. The text mentions the hot, sunny weather in the area where the Sumerians lived, which made crops grow quickly but also made it dicult to keep them alive. The Sumerians solved this problem by using river water for their farming—as a result, they often harvested more crops than were needed in a season. It follows that the Sumerians must have needed to nd something to do with the surplus crops—that is, they stored the extra crops for later use. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn’t logically follow that a surplus in crops would lead the Sumerians to choose only certain days of the season to harvest. Nor is there any indication in the text that the Sumerians improved their farming methods with the goal of reducing the time spent farming. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the Sumerians tried to shield their crops from the sun: in fact, the text indicates that the sunny weather helped crops grow very quickly and that the Sumerians used river water to allow crops to be exposed to the sun without dying. Choice C is incorrect. Having a surplus of crops wouldn’t have caused the Sumerians to begin farming until long after 4000 BCE: in fact, since the text indicates that the Sumerian civilization formed around 4000 BCE and farming was a part of that civilization, the statement that Sumerians only began farming long after 4000 BCE isn’t supported by the text.",

    question:
      "Compiled in the late 1500s largely through the efforts of Indigenous scribes, Cantares Mexicanos is the most important collection of poetry in Classical Nahuatl, the principal language of the Aztec Empire. The poems portray Aztec society before the occupation of the empire by the army of Spain, and marginal notes in Cantares Mexicanos indicate that much of the collection’s content predates the initial invasion. Nonetheless, some of the poems contain inarguable references to beliefs and customs common in Spain during this era. Thus, some scholars have concluded that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. while its content largely predates the invasion, Cantares Mexicanos also contains additions made after the invasion.",
    optionB:
      "B. although those who compiled Cantares Mexicanos were uent in Nahuatl, they had limited knowledge of the Spanish language.",
    optionC:
      "C. before the invasion by Spain, the poets of the Aztec Empire borrowed from the literary traditions of other societies.",
    optionD:
      "D. the references to beliefs and customs in Spain should be attributed to a coincidental resemblance between the societies of Spain and the Aztec Empire.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text. The text explains that the Cantares Mexicanos contains poems about the Aztec Empire from before the Spanish invasion. Furthermore, it indicates that notes in the collection attest that some of these poems predate the Spanish invasion, while some customs depicted are likely Spanish in origin. The implication is that some poems were composed before the invasion but the references to Spanish customs could have come about only after the invasion, and thus that the collection includes content that predates the invasion and also content from after the invasion. Choice B is incorrect because the text clearly indicates that the collection is in Nahuatl, not Spanish, so the compilers’ unfamiliarity with Spanish is irrelevant to whether the collection contains material composed after the Spanish invasion. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions only the Aztec Empire and Spain: there is no information about the relationship of Aztec literature to any traditions other than its own or Spain’s. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some of the poems make “inarguable references” to common Spanish customs, which conicts with the idea that these references can reasonably be attributed to mere coincidence.",

Specically, researchers are concerned that the longer a species has been extinct, the less likely it is that a suitable habitat still exists for that species. Among candidate species for de-extinction, this problem would be especially concerning for the ______ Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?",

    optionD:
      "D. Caribbean monk seal (Monachus tropicalis), which became extinct in 1952.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it uses data from the table to complete the statement regarding a species for which the problem of nding a suitable habitat would be especially concerning. For each candidate species, the table lists its common name, scientic name, and when the species became extinct. The text explains that scientists pursing de-extinction for the candidate species also consider the length of time that has passed since the species’ extinction, noting that the longer the animal has been extinct, the less likely it is that a suitable habitat would exist for the species today. The possibility of not having a suitable habitat would be especially concerning for the candidate species for which the most time has passed since its extinction. According to the table this species would be the saber-toothed cat, which became extinct 11,000 years before present. Choice A is incorrect because it compares the time since the extinction of the passenger pigeon to the time since the extinction of the huia instead of citing the species listed in the table that has been extinct the longest (the saber-toothed cat). The text indicates that the longer a species has been extinct, the lower the chances are that a suitable habitat exists for it today. Neither the table nor the text supports the claim that the passenger pigeon is especially vulnerable to this problem. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that the longer a species has been extinct, the less likely it is that there would be a suitable habitat available for the species today. So, the problem would be especially concerning for the saber-toothed cat, which became extinct several thousand years before the woolly mammoth did—not the other way around. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that the longer a species has been extinct, the lower the chances are that a suitable habitat would be available for that species today.

    question:
      "“Gestures” in painting are typically thought of as bold, expressive brushstrokes. In the 1970s, American painter Jack Whitten built a 12-foot (3.7-meter) tool he named the “developer” to apply paint to an entire canvas in one motion, resulting in his series of “slab” paintings from that decade. Whitten described this process as making an entire painting in “one gesture,” signaling a clear departure from the prevalence of gestures in his work from the 1960s. Some art historians claim this shift represents “removing gesture” from the process. Therefore, regardless of whether using the developer constitutes a gesture, both Whitten and these art historians likely agree that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. any tool that a painter uses to create an artwork is capable of creating gestures.",
    optionB:
      "B. Whitten’s work from the 1960s exhibits many more gestures than his work from the 1970s does.",

But putting that debate aside, both Whitten and the historians would agree that the paintings he made with the tool in the ’70s have way fewer gestures than his paintings from the ’60s, in which gestures are “prevalent,” meaning widely and extensively present. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text only discusses the “developer”—it never mentions other tools. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. If anything, the text suggests the opposite: that Whitten became more interested in exploring the role of gesture in his work as his career progressed, as his earlier paintings had many gestures, and his ’70s paintings only had “one gesture.” Choice D is incorrect.

    optionD:
      "D. people from Scotland abandoned their emphasis on the “r” sound after relocating to the Upland South.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of English dialects spoken in Scotland and the Upland South. The text indicates that these dialects share a feature: putting emphasis on the "r" sound when it appears in certain positions in words. The text goes on to state that records indicate the Upland South was colonized largely by people of Scottish ancestry. It is reasonable to assume that the English dialects spoken by these colonizers were inuenced by the English dialects spoken by their ancestors in Scotland. It follows, then, that the emphasis on the "r" sound in the dialects in Scotland carried over into the Upland South dialects as they developed—that is, that the Upland South dialects likely acquired it from dialects spoken in Scotland. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Scottish ancestry explains the origin of the emphasis on the "r" sound in English dialects spoken in the Upland South, since that linguistic feature is also found in dialects spoken in Scotland; the text doesn’t address any other dialects or suggest that the feature will spread elsewhere. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many Upland South colonizers were the descendants of Scottish people, suggesting that the English dialects spoken by these colonizers had been inuenced by the English dialects spoken by the colonizers’ ancestors in Scotland and had acquired their emphasis on the "r" sound from those ancestors’ dialects—not the other way around. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the emphasis on the "r" sound is part of English dialects spoken in the Upland South today, which almost certainly wouldn’t be the case if people from Scotland, who were the main colonizers of the Upland South, had eliminated that linguistic feature from their dialects.',

They found that, although languages vary widely in the speed at which they are spoken, the amount of information languages can effectively convey tends to vary much less. Thus, they claim that two languages with very different spoken rates can nonetheless convey the same amount of information in a given amount of time.

    optionD:
      "D. Serbian and Spanish are spoken at approximately the same rate, but Serbian conveys information faster than Spanish does.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that two languages can convey similar amounts of information even if they’re spoken at different rates. The table shows the approximate rates at which ve languages are spoken and the rates at which those ve languages convey information. Vietnamese is spoken at around 5.3 syllables per second, whereas Spanish is spoken at around 7.7 syllables per second, but the two languages convey information at very similar rates: Vietnamese at a rate of around 42.5 bits per second and Spanish at a rate of around 42.0 bits per second. Thus, the description of Vietnamese conveying information at around the same rate that Spanish does despite being spoken more slowly supports the claim in the text that languages can convey the same amount of information even if spoken at different rates. Choice A is incorrect because it isn’t true that Thai and Hungarian have the lowest rates of speech of the ve languages shown. According to the table, Hungarian is spoken at around 5.9 syllables per second, which is faster than Vietnamese (5.3 syllables per second). Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that two languages are spoken the slowest and convey information the slowest wouldn’t support the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they’re spoken at different rates. Choice C is incorrect because it isn’t true that the fastest-spoken language (Spanish, at 7.7 syllables per second) also conveys information the fastest: Spanish conveys information at 42.0 bits per second, which is slower than the 42.5 bits-per-second rate at which Vietnamese conveys information. Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that the language spoken the fastest also conveys information the fastest has no bearing on the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they’re spoken at different rates. Choice D is incorrect because it isn’t true that Serbian conveys information faster than Spanish does.

Choice A is incorrect because this quotation provides historical information about the BBC, not information about the inspiration for the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR. This quotation, therefore, is irrelevant to the student’s claim that the BBC inspired the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created NPR. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation contrasts the lack of competition faced by the BBC with the substantial competition faced by NPR, which has no bearing on the student’s claim that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR were inspired by the BBC. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation focuses on a common belief among US politicians that inspired Congress’s embrace of publicly funded broadcasting. The quotation doesn’t say anything about the BBC and therefore doesn’t support the claim that the BBC inspired Congress to create the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created NPR.",

The researchers began by showing study participants an ad for a product, with some seeing a less detailed ad and others seeing a more detailed one. Then, all participants viewed the same second ad for a store and shared their opinion of the store based on this second ad. Participants who had rst seen an ad less detailed than the second ad had a higher opinion of the store than the participants who had rst seen a more detailed ad. The researchers concluded that reactions to an ad may be affected by ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA: "A. the number of people who viewed the a",
    optionB: "B. the length of time viewing previous ads.",
    optionC: "C. the amount of detail viewed in previous ads.",

      "Choice C is the best answer. The passage tells us that participants who had seen a less detailed ad for a product beforehand had a higher opinion of the store than those who had seen a more detailed ad. This suggests that reactions to an ad may be affected by the amount of detail viewed in previous ads. Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the number of people who viewed the ad, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect.

    question:
      "The following text is adapted from Jack London’s 1903 novel The Call of the Wild. Buck is a sled dog living with John Thornton in Yukon, Canada. Thornton alone held [Buck]. The rest of mankind was as nothing. Chance travellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all, and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. When Thornton’s partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft, Buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to Thornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Buck has become less social since he began living with Thornton.",
    optionB: "B. Buck mistrusts humans and does his best to avoid them.",
    optionC:
      "C. Buck has been especially well liked by most of Thornton’s friends.",
    optionD: "D. Buck holds Thornton in higher regard than any other person.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. After establishing that Buck views most people “as nothing,” the text explains that Buck won’t acknowledge people other than Thornton unless they appear friendly toward Thornton, and even then he’s only reluctantly accepting. Thus, the text focuses on the idea that Thornton has a special status in Buck’s mind, with Buck holding him in higher regard than other people. Choice A is incorrect because the text conveys that Buck isn’t social with people other than Thornton but doesn’t address Buck’s life or temperament before he lived with Thornton. Choice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Buck doesn’t really care about people other than Thornton and is aloof toward them. However, there’s no indication that Buck mistrusts and avoids people generally; indeed, he accepts Thornton, who is a human. Choice C is incorrect because the text refers to random travelers praising and petting Buck and Thornton’s partners giving Buck favors, but there’s no indication that any of these people are Thornton’s friends or that they have a particular fondness for Buck.",

      "Optical tweezers are specialized scientic tools—particularly useful in biology and medicine—that use high-powered beams of light to trap and manipulate minuscule particles for study. Use of the tool has led to several scientic and medical breakthroughs over the last few decades, but the particles are often under prolonged exposure to the intense heat of the light beams. To overcome the risk of overheating, and thereby damage, researchers sometimes attach nano-sized glass beads to particles, allowing the light to focus on the beads instead of the particles. Based on the text, what is one advantage of attaching glass beads to particles when using optical tweezers?",
    optionA:
      "A. It decreases the time it takes for the optical tweezers to locate and capture the particles.",
    optionB:
      "B. It facilitates the maneuvering of particles without directly heating the particles themselves.",
    optionC:

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. The text says that the glass beads get the "focus" of the light beams so that the particles don’t overheat. From this, we can infer that the beads allow the particles to be manipulated without being directly heated by the light beams. Choice A is incorrect. The text never says that attaching the glass beads saves time in any way. Choice C is incorrect. The text never says that attaching the glass beads allows researchers to use weaker light beams.

Performance scholar Susan Manning observes that many choreographers, like playwrights and musical theater writers, are concerned with storytelling and characterization. In fact, some choreographers describe the dances they create as expressions of narrative through movement; it is therefore unsurprising that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",

      "D. some directors and actors rely too heavily on dramaturges to complete certain research tasks.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. Dramaturges help playwrights with storytelling and characterization. Choreographers often tell stories through dance, so they are also concerned with storytelling and characterization. This suggests that the fact that choreographers seek the help of dramaturges with the storytelling aspects of their dances should be “unsurprising.” Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The beginning of the text does imply that this is true, but the end is leading to a conclusion about how choreographers use dramaturges. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never mentions dances by choreographers who don’t incorporate narrative elements. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text mentions in passing that directors use dramaturges to conduct research, but it never suggests that directors and actors are too reliant on them.

    question:
      "A member of the Otomi, an Indigenous people in Central Mexico, Octavio Medellín immigrated to the United States as a child, and his sculpture bears the impress of traditions on both sides of the border: US-based modernist sculpture, Mexican modernist painting, Otomi art, and the ancient sculpture of other Mexican Indigenous peoples, including the Maya. In his 1950 masterpiece History of Mexico, Medellín fuses these inuences into a style so idiosyncratic that it resists efforts to view his work through the lens of nationality or cultural identity. Artists, he insisted, should strive for individual expression, even as they draw inspiration from their heritage and the communities where they live and work. Which quotation from an art critic most directly challenges the underlined claim in the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. “Although a number of ancient Indigenous artistic traditions pictured human forms in prole, the forms populating the surface of A History of Mexico suggest a\nspecically Maya inuence.”",
    optionB:
      "B. “In A History of Mexico, the synthesis of ancient and modernist traditions functions as a stylistic parallel to the work’s subject matter: a survey of centuries of\nMexican history.”",
    optionC:
      "C. “Many critics focus on Indigenous inuences in A History of Mexico and other key works by Medellín to the exclusion of inuences from non-Indigenous art.”",
    optionD:
      "D. “While A History of Mexico features modernist motifs, it relies primarily on angular human forms in prole—a staple of Maya sculpture—and thus invites\nclassication as Indigenous art.”",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. This critic challenges the claim by arguing that A History of Mexico is not so idiosyncratic (unique) as to resist classication because its use of Maya-style human proles actually “invites classication as Indigenous art.” Therefore, according to this critic, the work can be viewed, at least partially, through a lens of national or cultural identity. Choice A is incorrect. While it describes the Maya inuence on a particular aspect of A History of Mexico, this quotation doesn’t push back on Medellín’s “idiosyncratic” (unique) style, nor does it try to categorize the entire work into a single cultural tradition. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t directly challenge the underlined claim, but rather supports it. It suggests that the work effectively blends a variety of artistic products to create a single work that can’t be dened by any one tradition. Instead, the work recalls many centuries of history and culture all at once. Choice C is incorrect. This choice supports rather than challenges the underlined claim. The quotation argues that other critics focus too much on Indigenous inuences on the artwork instead of viewing all of the inuences equally— that they should instead be viewing the work as an idiosyncratic whole instead of through one or two narrow cultural lenses.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, articial leaves are a renewable energy technology that’s in development and generating interest. The text goes on to state that articial-leaf technology "is not yet commercially viable as a large-scale energy source" and that scientists from several elds are doing additional research to rene the technology. Thus, the main idea is that continued research and development in articial-leaf technology is needed before the devices can be widely used as an energy source. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that scientists from many elds are researching articial leaves, they’re doing so to address the fact that the leaves are not yet commercially viable, rather than in response to an increase in commercial use. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does explain that articial leaves help split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen gas using catalysts, it doesn’t argue that this process is more ecient than photosynthesis. This is merely a detail of the text and not the main idea, which is about the additional research needed to improve the cost and eciency of these articial leaves. Choice D is incorrect.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion about the signicance of the cupid found at Pompeii. The text indicates that the cupid is near a statue of a female gure who is shing, and it goes on to indicate that because Venus is associated with cupids, some scholars believe the female gure to be the goddess Venus. But the text then says that, according to archaeologist Carla Brain, cupids may have also been associated with the activity of shing, which, if true, would suggest that the mere appearance of a cupid near a female gure engaged in shing does not indicate with certainty that the gure is Venus (that is, the cupid might be associated with shing, and the gure might be anyone at all). Choice B is incorrect because the text says nothing about how often Venus was depicted shing in Roman art: it only implies that in certain instances a female gure may or may not be Venus. Choice C is incorrect because Carla Brain’s proposed explanation for the presence of the cupids makes no reference to the female gure, and so the possibility that the gure in the artworks is in fact Venus cannot be denitively eliminated.

      "D. French people with signicant foreign investments were unlikely to have the right to vote.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. We’re told that people needed to pay “at least 300 francs in direct taxes” to be able to vote. We’re also told that, while “relatively few people paid the tax on real estate,” real estate taxes were both the main way people qualied to vote and the main source of revenue for the government. Based on this, we can infer that those who did qualify to vote likely had signicant French real estate holdings. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the voting habits of artisans and merchants nor any reduction in tax burdens on businesses, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although we know that doors and windows were taxed during the Bourbon Restoration, we don’t have enough information to infer if doors and windows increased after this time. Choice D is incorrect. Although we know that foreign investments were only minimally taxed, we don’t have enough information to determine if those with signicant foreign investments were unlikely to have voting rights. For example, it’s possible that those with signicant foreign investments were likely to also be people with signicant domestic investments which they did pay taxes on, so we don’t have the information necessary to make this inference.",

    question:
      "The following text is adapted from Lewis Carroll’s 1889 satirical novel Sylvie and Bruno. A crowd has gathered outside a room belonging to the Warden, an ocial who reports to the Lord Chancellor. One man, who was more excited than the rest, ung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as well as I could make out) “Who roar for the Sub-Warden?” Everybody roared, but whether it was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly appear: some were shouting “Bread!” and some “Taxes!”, but no one seemed to know what it was they really wanted. All this I saw from the open window of the Warden’s breakfast-saloon, looking across the shoulder of the Lord Chancellor. “What can it all mean?” he kept repeating to himself. “I never heard such shouting before—and at this time of the morning, too! And with such unanimity!” Based on the text, how does the Lord Chancellor respond to the crowd?",
    optionA:
      "A. He asks about the meaning of the crowd’s shouting, even though he claims to know what the crowd wants.",
    optionB:
      "B. He indicates a desire to speak to the crowd, even though the crowd has asked to speak to the Sub-Warden.",

      "C. He expresses sympathy for the crowd’s demands, even though the crowd’s shouting annoys him.",
    optionD:
      "D. He describes the crowd as being united, even though the crowd clearly appears otherwise.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about how the Lord Chancellor responds to the crowd that is supported by the text. The text indicates that the people in the crowd are roaring and shouting “Bread!” or “Taxes!” and presents them as not knowing what they really want. The Lord Chancellor’s response is to ask what their shouting means but also to observe that they’re shouting with “unanimity,” or total agreement. Clearly, this isn’t the case, which supports the statement that the Lord Chancellor describes the crowd as being united even though it’s not. Choice A is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text. Although the text indicates that the Lord Chancellor asks about the meaning of the crowd’s shouting, it doesn’t suggest that he knows what the crowd really wants. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the Lord Chancellor wants to speak to the crowd. Furthermore, the text doesn’t indicate that the crowd wants to hear from the Sub-Warden. Although the crowd roars when asked “Who roar for the SubWarden?” it’s unclear what the roaring means. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the Lord Chancellor knows of or sympathizes with the crowd’s demands. In addition, the text doesn’t indicate that the crowd’s shouting annoys the Lord Chancellor, just that it causes him to keep repeating “What can it all mean?”",

This resemblance is perhaps attributable to cultural contact: such words could have entered Caddo through the intermediary of the neighboring but unrelated Chitimacha language, concurrent with the dissemination of corn itself from Mexico into the Southeast after 700 CE. That the vocabulary pertaining to domestic crops accompanies them as they diffuse into new regions is an established phenomenon globally. Crops may also be decoupled from vocabulary altogether: corn cultivation became ubiquitous among the Southeastern tribes, yet ______ Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?",

Alongside each piece of fabric, Alspaugh recorded intimate memories, such as dressmaking with her sister. Additionally, she listed the prices and how she used the fabric. Historians note that by representing fty years of changing textures, patterns, and dress styles, the scrapbook is a record of nineteenthcentury textiles and dressmaking as well as Alspaugh’s life.

The text says that it was common for American women to keep scrapbooks of fabric pieces in the nineteenth century, and it says that Alspaugh was one of these women. However, it never says that other women were inspired by Alspaugh. Choice B is incorrect. This is too general and too strong. The text says that Alspaugh’s scrapbook is a historical record of nineteenth-century textiles and dressmaking, but it never says that historians rely on such scrapbooks in general to understand how fashions changed throughout that time period. This choice also fails to even mention Alspaugh, who is the real focus of the text. Choice C is incorrect. The text does say this, but it’s a detail—not the main idea.

The data show that the marsquakes all started from the same location on the planet.

Now, scientists believe that there could be areas of active magma ows deep beneath the planet’s surface that trigger the marsquakes. According to the text, what was surprising to scientists studying the seismic activity data from NASA’s InSight lander?",

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about what surprised the scientists that is supported by the text. The text states that the marsquakes described in the data from NASA’s InSight lander originated from the same location on Mars. The text goes on to say that because they had expected the opposite (that marsquakes would originate from all over the planet) this discovery surprised the scientists. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t say that the data from NASA’s InSight lander revealed any surprising information about the planet’s surface temperature. Instead, the text mentions the cooling of Mars’s surface as a reason the scientists expected that marsquakes had multiple origins. In addition, cooling would indicate that the temperature has been falling rather than rising. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that by studying seismic activity scientists found a possible explanation for what causes marsquakes, the text doesn’t say that they discovered that marsquakes are caused by different types of seismic waves.

      "D. “Faithful to your principles, now and for ever! Ah, that is how a man should be!”",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim in the text that Hedda seeks to inuence another character’s fate. In the quotation, Hedda says that she wants “to have power to mould a human destiny,” or shape a person’s fate, just as the text indicates. Additionally, the phrase “for once in my life” suggests that Hedda feels that she has never been able to shape anyone’s life, including her own, supporting the text’s assertion that she “is unable to freely determine her own future.” Choice A is incorrect because this quotation shows Hedda being uncertain about what to do with her own life, not wanting to inuence another person’s fate. Choice C is incorrect because while this quotation shows Hedda’s interest in nding out whether she has any power over another character, it doesn’t clearly show that she wants to inuence that person’s fate. In this quotation, Hedda seems to have inferred or concluded (“then”) that she doesn’t have any inuence over the person to whom she’s speaking, and she’s asking that person to conrm her lack of inuence.

Although many believe that only modern humans developed systems for notating numbers, one archaeologist asserts that this artifact may be a sign that Neanderthals also recorded numerical information. The notches on the bone are unevenly spaced but approximately parallel, and microscopic analysis reveals that they were made with a single stone tool; according to the archaeologist, this suggests that the notches were all made at one time by one individual as a means of counting something. Which nding, if true, would most directly weaken the underlined claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. Parallel lines are a common feature in modern humans’ early systems for recording numerical information.",

    optionD:
      "D. Decorative art discovered at another Neanderthal site in western France primarily features patterns of unevenly spaced parallel lines.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. The archeologist bases their claim on the fact that the hyena bone features unevenly spaced parallel notches. But if unevenly spaced parallel lines were found on "decorative art" at another Neanderthal site, it would suggest that the hyena bone is probably decorative art as well—not a counting tool. Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. If anything, it might actually strengthen the claim: assuming we can make an inference about Neanderthals using a fact about early humans, it provides more support for the idea that the person who made the notches was counting something. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. The fact that another artifact had parallel notches made with a different stone tool doesn’t tell us anything about the use of either artifact. For all we know, they could both have been used for counting. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim.

      'Choice D is the best answer because it presents a description of how Zerviah Holme felt that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Holme "did not like to be interrupted" while reading Gibbon and that he considered interruptions to be "an insult." Furthermore, the text suggests that Gibbon is Holme’s favorite author because, as the text states, "he was always reading Gibbon." Thus, Holme would have felt annoyed at having been interrupted when the letter was delivered. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Holme is relieved to receive the letter.

    optionD:
      "D. Works that were edited by Toni Morrison during her time at Random House displayed stylistic characteristics that distinguished them from works that were not\nedited by Morrison.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support the scholar’s claim about Toni Morrison’s likely goal of strengthening the presence of Black writers on Random House’s list of published authors. The text explains that Morrison was the rst Black woman to be an editor for Random House and that she was an editor there from 1967 to 1983. If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s—during most of Morrison’s time working there—than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House’s published authors, thus supporting the scholar’s claim. Choice B is incorrect because the scholar’s claim is about Morrison’s work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company’s list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison’s novels as an inuence on their work, but that nding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn’t show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar’s claim is about Morrison’s work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist. Therefore, a nding that Morrison’s novels published after 1983 sold more copies and were more widely acclaimed than her earlier novels would have no bearing on the claim that as an editor Morrison made an effort to ensure that more Black writers were present on Random House’s list of published authors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses Morrison’s work as an editor at Random House, the scholar’s claim focuses on Morrison’s likely effort in that role to increase the number of Black writers present on Random House’s list of published authors, not on the inuence she may have had on the content of the works she edited. Without knowing whether Morrison’s stylistic inuence led to more publications or if Morrison applied her inuence specically to works by Black writers, the nding that works edited by Morrison could be identied by stylistic characteristics would have no bearing on the claim that Morrison intended to strengthen the presence of Black writers among the published authors at Random House.",

    optionD:
      "D. “And so the years go swiftly by, / Each, coming, brings ambitions high, / And each, departing, leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.”",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the quotation that most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker of the poem describes experiencing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reection. In this quotation, the speaker notes that as years go by, “Each, coming”—that is, each new year as it comes—“brings ambitions high.” In other words, the speaker begins each new year with large goals. But the speaker goes on to say that as each year ends (“each, departing”), it “leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.” A sigh is an expression of longing or regret, so in the context of the whole quotation, this portion suggests that at the end of each year, the speaker regretfully reects on not having achieved the ambitions formed at the beginning of the year. The phrases “the years go swiftly by,” “Each, coming,” and “each, departing” indicate that this experience happens over and over again: the speaker experiences a cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reection. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation does not describe an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reection. Instead, the speaker describes experiencing a sensation similar to fright as a result of something that has occurred at midnight. Specically, the speaker has heard a “brazen tongue,” a gurative way of saying that the speaker has heard the clang of a bronze bell being rung. Choice B is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of anticipation through its reference to “ominous stillness,” there is no suggestion of regretful reection or any indication that the speaker is describing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by such reection. Instead, the speaker is describing a particular moment when a winter storm appears to have momentarily calmed. Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of regret (“many a squandered day”), nothing in the quotation suggests an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regret. Instead, the speaker is simply lamenting wasted time and opportunities.",

    optionD:
      "D. “When [the banker] got home he lay on his bed, but his tears and emotion kept him for hours from sleeping.”",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from "The Bet" to illustrate the claim that the banker was very upset about something. The quotation indicates that the banker shed tears, which suggests that he was likely unhappy about something, and that his emotions were so strong that they kept him from sleeping for hours. These details suggest that the banker was very upset. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation mainly describes the banker cautiously unlocking a door; it doesn’t suggest that he was particularly upset about anything. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t mention whether the banker was experiencing any particularly strong negative feelings; instead, the quotation focuses on the quietness of the setting. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation states that the banker was feeling "delighted," not that he was upset.',

    question:
      "Some animal-behavior studies involve observing wild animals in their natural habitat, and some involve capturing wild animals and observing them in a laboratory. Each approach has advantages over the other. In wild studies, researchers can more easily presume that the animals are behaving normally, and in lab studies, researchers can more easily control factors that might affect the results. But if, for example, the results from a wild study and a lab study of Western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) contradict each other, one or both of the studies must have failed to account for some factor that was relevant to the birds’ behavior. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. When the results of a natural-habitat study and those from a lab study of a wild animal such as the Western scrub-jay conict, the study in the natural habitat is\nmore likely than the lab study to have accurate results.",
    optionB:
      "B. Studying wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay in both their natural habitat and lab settings is likely to yield conicting results that researchers cannot fully\nresolve.",
    optionC:
      "C. Wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay can be effectively studied in their natural habitat and in the lab, but each approach has drawbacks that could affect\nthe accuracy of the ndings.",
    optionD:
      "D. Differing results between natural-habitat and lab studies of wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay are a strong indication that both of the studies had\ndesign aws that affected the accuracy of their results.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by explaining that wild animals can be studied in their natural habitat or in a laboratory setting, with each setting offering unique advantages to researchers. The text then highlights an instance in which Western scrubjays were studied in both settings but with conicting results, indicating that one or both studies may have failed to account for the disadvantages of its research setting. Thus, the main idea of the text is that while wild animals can be effectively studied in natural or lab settings, there are drawbacks to each that need to be considered to ensure accurate results. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not position one study setting (natural or lab) as superior to the other; rather, the text states that each one has advantages over the other. Choice B is incorrect. The text provides a hypothetical example of two studies in different environments with conicting results, but this single example cannot be extrapolated to a general claim about the likelihood that results of studies in different environments will conict. Additionally, the text does not assert anything about how researchers can or cannot resolve conicting study results. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not state that discrepancies between natural-habitat and lab-based animal behavior studies are due to both of the designs being awed. Rather, the text states that the conict in results can be the consequence of one or both of the studies having failed to account for some factor.",

    question:
      "In her 1998 book Blues Legacies and Black Feminism, Angela Y. Davis bases her analysis in part on recordings of songs sung in the 1920s by Gertrude “Ma” Rainey and Bessie Smith. Davis focuses on how Rainey and Smith improvised the lyrics—replacing the original lines with mischievous jokes and wordplay. Davis’s work was particularly labor intensive because in order to transcribe, or write down, the lyrics as Rainey and Smith sang them, Davis had to listen repeatedly to the vinyl recordings, which weren’t very clear. What does the text most strongly suggest about the songs sung by Rainey and Smith?",
    optionA:
      "A. The songs have grown in popularity since Rainey and Smith rst sang them.",
    optionB:
      "B. There were more recordings made of Rainey’s songs than there were of Smith’s.",

    optionD:
      "D. According to Davis, the songs sung by Rainey were more musically innovative than those sung by Smith typically were.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it describes the songs sung by Gertrude "Ma" Rainey and Bessie Smith in a way the text implies is accurate. The text describes Angela Y. Davis’s research on Rainey and Smith for her book Blues Legacies and Black Feminism, focusing on her efforts to transcribe the improvised lyrics in Rainey’s and Smith’s songs. The text calls Davis’s transcription process "labor intensive" since the lack of clarity in the recordings required her to listen to each repeatedly to verify the accuracy of her transcripts. The fact that Davis undertook a painstaking transcription process using only fairly low-delity recordings suggests that reliable transcriptions were otherwise unavailable to her. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss the popularity of Rainey’s and Smith’s songs either in the 1920s or after. Although it is plausible that the music of Rainey and Smith is more widely enjoyed than it was in the 1920s, this isn’t supported by the text. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss which of Rainey and Smith was the more prolic recording artist and so provides no support for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the creativity of both Rainey and Smith, but it does so only to note similarities between them in terms of improvisation and wit, not to emphasize differences between them or Davis’s relative views of the artists’ inventiveness.',

This idea is also supported by evidence that rocky planets in our solar system are composed of some of the same materials as the Sun.

    optionD:
      "D. The method for determining the composition of rocky planets is discovered to be less effective when used to analyze other kinds of planets.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would weaken the astronomers’ claim about the makeup of host stars and their planets. The text explains that because stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust, astronomers believe planets should be composed of the same materials as their host stars, but in equal or smaller quantities. The nding that the amount of iron in some rocky planets is much higher than the amount in their host star would weaken the astronomers’ claim because it would show that some planets contain the same material as their host star, but in higher quantities. Choice A is incorrect because a nding only about the makeup of stars, whether they’ve cooled or not, would provide no information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn’t have any bearing on the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice B is incorrect because a nding about two host stars having similar proportions of certain materials wouldn’t provide any information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn’t be relevant to the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the astronomers’ claim is based on a fact—that stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust in space—which would remain true regardless of the effectiveness of a method for analysis of compositions. The text does cite analysis of rocky planets in our solar system and the Sun, but only as a single piece of evidence that is consistent with the claim and not as the source of the claim; the nding that the method used for that analysis is less effective in other scenarios wouldn’t weaken a claim that’s based on knowledge of how stars and planets initially form.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because the quotation from The Souls of Black Folk illustrates the claim that Du Bois felt a sense of cultural recognition when he heard Black folk songs. In the quotation, Du Bois explains that for his entire life, Black folk songs “stirred [him] strangely.” Even though they originated in the South, a region he wasn’t familiar with, he knew the songs “as of me and of mine.” That is, he identied strongly with them and associated them with his community. Therefore, Du Bois felt an intuitive sense of cultural recognition when he heard Black folk songs. Choice A is incorrect. Although the quotation considers the cultural and spiritual value of Black folk music, it doesn’t establish that this music inspired in Du Bois a sense of cultural recognition.

    optionD:
      "D. A survey of archaeologists showed that few of them received dedicated training in how to properly categorize pottery fragments.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text explains that although archaeologists hold that categorizing pottery fragments relies on both objective criteria and instinct developed through direct experience, researchers have found that a computer model can categorize the fragments with the same degree of accuracy as the humans can—a nding that has caused some archaeologists to worry that their own work won’t be needed any longer. If survey results indicate that categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount of time archaeologists can dedicate to other important tasks that only human experts can do, that would mean that computer models aren’t able to do all of the important things archaeologists do, thus supporting the researchers’ claim that computer models are unlikely to replace human archaeologists. Choice A is incorrect because if it were true that the computer model could categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the archaeologists could, that would weaken the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models, since it would demonstrate that the models could conduct the archaeologists’ work not only with equal accuracy but also at a faster pace. Choice B is incorrect because the inability of both the computer model and the archaeologists to accurately categorize all of the pottery fragments presented wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text indicates that some archaeologists are worried because the computer model’s accuracy is equal to their own, and that could be the case whether both were perfectly accurate or were unable to achieve complete accuracy. Choice D is incorrect because survey results showing that few archaeologists received special training in properly categorizing pottery fragments wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The amount of special training in categorizing pottery fragments that archaeologists have received has no direct bearing on whether computer models’ success at categorizing fragments will lead to the models replacing the archaeologists.",

    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support Stöger and her team’s claim that giraffes use humming to communicate when they cannot signal to one another visually. The text indicates that scientists have long thought that giraffes produce little sound and exclusively rely on visual signals to communicate with one another. The text goes on to say, however, that Stöger and her team have recorded giraffes in three European zoos making a lowpitched humming sound, which the team claims the giraffes use to communicate when they cannot see each other. If the giraffes produced these sounds when visual communication was impossible and never produced them otherwise, that would support Stöger and her team’s claim about the circumstance in which giraffes make the sound. Choice A is incorrect because nding that giraffes have excellent vision and can see in color would have no bearing on Stöger and her team’s claim that giraffes produce a low-pitched humming noise to communicate when they cannot communicate visually. As presented in the text, Stöger and her team’s claim is restricted to circumstances in which giraffes cannot signal one another visually; if the giraffes are unable to signal visually, their sense of vision is irrelevant to their communication. Choice C is incorrect because nding that wild giraffes have never been recorded making humming noises would not support Stöger and her team’s claim about the function of the humming noise that the researchers recorded from the giraffes in European zoos. The text provides no information about whether researchers have even attempted to record low-pitched humming in wild giraffes, so nothing can be concluded about the implications of the lack of such recordings. Choice D is incorrect because nding that other animals in European zoos had been observed humming would not support Stöger and her team’s claim, since it would not indicate anything about why giraffes produce humming sounds.

    question:
      "To make her art more widely available, graphic artist Elizabeth Catlett turned to linocuts. In linocut printing, an artist carves an image into a sheet of linoleum to create a stamp that is used to mass-produce prints. In the linocut series The Black Woman (1946–1947), Catlett depicts the everyday experiences of Black women alongside the achievements of well-known Black women. This pairing invites the viewer to draw connections among the women. The linocut process enabled Catlett’s work to reach a wide audience and supported her aim to unite Black women through her art. According to the text, what is signicant about Catlett’s use of linocut printing?",
    optionA:
      "A. Linocut printing involved using materials that were readily available to Catlett.",
    optionB:
      "B. Linocut printing helped Catlett use art to connect people, especially Black women.",
    optionC:
      "C. Catlett became commercially successful once she started using linocut printing.",
    optionD:
      "D. Catlett was one of the rst Black artists to use linocut printing.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. The last sentence states that the linocut process “supported her [Catlett’s] aim to unite Black women through her art.” Choice A is incorrect. The text briey describes the linocut printing process but doesn’t discuss the availability of the materials used in the process. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that the linocut process “enabled Catlett’s work to reach a wide audience,” but that doesn’t mean that linocuts made her “commercially successful.” In other words, we don’t know how much money she made off her linocuts—we only know that more people were able to see her work. Choice D is incorrect. The text says that Catlett depicted Black women in her linocuts, but not that she was one of the rst Black artists to use linocut printing.",

    question:
      "The following text is adapted from Charles W. Chesnutt’s 1901 novel The Marrow of Tradition. Mrs. Ochiltree was a woman of strong individuality, whose comments upon her acquaintance[s], present or absent, were marked by a frankness at times no less than startling. This characteristic caused her to be more or less avoided. Mrs. Ochiltree was aware of this sentiment on the part of her acquaintance[s], and rather exulted in it. Based on the text, what is true about Mrs. Ochiltree’s acquaintances?",
    optionA:
      "A. They try to refrain from discussing topics that would upset Mrs. Ochiltree.",
    optionB:
      "B. They are unable to spend as much time with Mrs. Ochiltree as she would like.",
    optionC:
      "C. They are too preoccupied with their own concerns to speak with Mrs. Ochiltree.",
    optionD:
      "D. They are likely offended by what Mrs. Ochiltree has said about them.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about Mrs. Ochiltree’s acquaintances that is supported by the text. The text indicates that Mrs. Ochiltree makes comments about her acquaintances that are frank, or direct and blunt, and sometimes startling. It also states that because of this behavior, the acquaintances tend to avoid Mrs. Ochiltree. Together, these details suggest that the acquaintances choose not to be around Mrs. Ochiltree because they are offended by the things she has said about them. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Mrs. Ochiltree’s acquaintances avoid discussing topics that would upset Mrs. Ochiltree; instead, it states that they avoid being around Mrs. Ochiltree at all. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes it clear that Mrs. Ochiltree knows her acquaintances often avoid her and is pleased about it (she “rather exulted in it”), not that she wants to spend more time with them. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Mrs. Ochiltree’s acquaintances don’t speak with Mrs. Ochiltree because they are too focused on their own concerns, but rather because they don’t like the frank comments she makes.",

    question:
      "Black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) are a nutritionally dense food, but they are dicult to digest in part because of their high levels of soluble ber and compounds like ranose. They also contain antinutrients like tannins and trypsin inhibitors, which interfere with the body’s ability to extract nutrients from foods. In a research article, Marisela Granito and Glenda Álvarez from Simón Bolívar University in Venezuela claim that inducing fermentation of black beans using lactic acid bacteria improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious. Which nding from Granito and Álvarez’s research, if true, would most directly support their claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. When cooked, fermented beans contained signicantly more trypsin inhibitors and tannins but signicantly less soluble ber and ranose than nonfermented\nbeans.",
    optionB:
      "B. Fermented beans contained signicantly less soluble ber and ranose than nonfermented beans, and when cooked, the fermented beans also displayed a\nsignicant reduction in trypsin inhibitors and tannins.",
    optionC:
      "C. When the fermented beans were analyzed, they were found to contain two microorganisms, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, that are theorized\nto increase the amount of nitrogen absorbed by the gut after eating beans.",
    optionD:
      "D. Both fermented and nonfermented black beans contained signicantly fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins after being cooked at high pressure.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a nding that would best support Granito and Álvarez’s claim that fermenting black beans makes them easier to digest and more nutritious. The text indicates that high levels of soluble ber and ranose in black beans make the beans hard to digest and that tannins and trypsin inhibitors make it harder for the body to extract nutrients from the beans. If it were found that fermenting the beans signicantly reduces their levels of soluble ber, ranose, trypsin inhibitors, and tannins when cooked, this would directly support the claim that fermentation improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that trypsin inhibitors and tannins interfere with the body’s ability to extract nutrients from black beans; if fermentation and cooking were found to increase these antinutrients, fermented beans would likely be less nutritious than unfermented ones, not more nutritious (as Granito and Álvarez claim). Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the idea that greater nitrogen absorption in the gut has an effect on a food’s digestibility or level of nutrition, so the discovery of the presence of microorganisms that may increase nitrogen absorption wouldn’t provide relevant support for the claim that fermentation makes black beans easier to digest and more nutritious. Choice D is incorrect because Granito and Álvarez’s claim focuses on the effect of fermenting black beans, but the nding that nonfermented black beans also have fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins when cooked at high pressure would suggest that the role of the cooking method could be signicant when it comes to nutrition; further, the nding wouldn’t address the beans’ digestibility.",

      "Mosses can struggle in harsh desert conditions because these plants require enough sunlight for photosynthesis but not so much that they risk drying out. Researchers Jenna Ekwealor and Kirsten M. Fisher found several species of Syntrichia caninervis, a type of desert moss, growing under quartz crystals in California’s Mojave Desert. To evaluate whether these semitransparent rocks beneted the moss, the researchers compared the shoot tissue, a measure of plant growth, of S. caninervis when growing on the soil surface versus when the moss was growing under the quartz rocks. They found that the shoot tissue was 62% longer for moss growing under the quartz as compared to moss on the soil surface, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. S. caninervis is one of the few types of moss that can survive under semitransparent rocks.",
    optionB:
      "B. quartz crystals do not transmit the necessary sunlight for photosynthesis in S. caninervis.",
    optionC:
      "C. S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture.",
    optionD:
      "D. quartz crystals are capable of supporting S. caninervis growth if the crystals are not too thin.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text. The text explains that while desert moss species need sucient sunlight for photosynthesis, exposure to sunlight can also affect the plants negatively by drying them out. Ekwealor and Fisher’s team found specimens of S. caninervis moss growing under quartz crystals that were semitransparent, allowing some but not all sunlight to pass through them, and the shoot tissue of these specimens was longer than that of S. caninervis specimens found growing on the surface that were unprotected by such crystals. Since, as the text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an indicator of plant growth, and since greater exposure to sunlight results in greater loss of moisture, it can be inferred that S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention another moss species besides S. caninervis or discuss whether other such species are able to grow under transparent crystals, as S. caninervis is. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text explains, specimens of S. caninervis were found growing under quartz crystals and exhibited more plant growth than specimens growing on the soil surface. This wouldn’t have been the case if the crystals transmitted insucient light for the moss’s photosynthesis. Choice D is incorrect. The text contrasts the growth of S. caninervis specimens found beneath semitransparent quartz crystals with that of specimens found on the soil surface absent such crystals, but it doesn’t make a comparison among specimens growing beneath crystals of different degrees of thickness or consider how the relative thickness of the crystals affects the growth of the moss.",

      "Conventional theories of rhetoric hold that presenting information as coming from credentialed experts increases that information’s credibility. When communications researcher Sungkyoung Lee and her colleagues tested messages seeking volunteers for clinical trials, however, they found that participants in their study judged recruitment messages from former trial volunteers as signicantly more credible than messages from doctors (i.e., credentialed experts). One reason for this may be that the doctors’ status as credentialed experts wasn’t ignored but rather was outweighed by participants’ views of the experiential relevance of the two types of messengers; that is, participants may have reacted the way they did because ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. messages from former trial volunteers depicted clinical trials as being more positive experiences than did messages from doctors.",
    optionB:
      "B. participants did not have enough experience to evaluate the credibility of the doctors’ messages but did have enough experience to evaluate the credibility of\nformer trial volunteers’ messages.",
    optionC:

    optionD:
      "D. participants regarded the experiences of both the doctors and former trial volunteers as relevant to the subject of clinical trials but were skeptical of the\ndoctors’ status as credentialed experts.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of how participants considered messages from former trial volunteers and doctors. The text rst establishes that information coming from credentialed experts typically increases the credibility of that information. However, the text goes on to describe a situation that goes against this expectation: the messages from previous trial volunteers were judged as more credible than the messages from licensed doctors when recruiting clinic trial participants. The text then goes on to speculate as to why this may have been the case, stating that participants likely considered the messages from the former trial volunteers to be more convincing than the messages from the doctors because the former trial volunteers were perceived as having undergone the same experience that the participants were considering. It is reasonable to infer, then, that participants regarded the former trial volunteers’ direct experience as more important to their decision-making than the doctors’ status as credentialed experts. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not provide any indication as to the content or the tone of the messages provided by either the doctors or the former trial volunteers regarding the clinical trials. Choice B is incorrect. Since the study participants had not themselves participated in the clinical trial, they could not rely on their experience to evaluate the credibility of either the former trial volunteers or the doctors. Choice D is incorrect. While the text does establish that the participants likely considered the messages from both the doctors and the former trial volunteers, it does not suggest that the participants doubted the doctors’ credentials. Rather, the text speculates that participants may have given the experiences of the former trial volunteers more importance than the doctors’ credentials when considering the recruitment messages.",

      "To better understand the burrowing habits of Alpheus bellulus (the tiger pistol shrimp), some studies have used resin casting to obtain precise measurements of the shrimps’ burrows. Resin casting involves completely lling an empty burrow with a liquid plastic that hardens to create a three-dimensional model; however, recovering the model inevitably requires destroying the burrow. In their 2022 study, Miyu Umehara and colleagues discovered that an x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner can accurately record a burrow’s measurements both at a moment in time and throughout the entire burrow-building process, something that’s impossible with resin casting because ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. Since resin casting “inevitably requires destroying the burrow,” it would be impossible to make multiple castings of the same burrow over time. Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t discuss size requirements for completing resin casting, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage never mentions how long the casting process takes nor how long A. bellulus takes to construct a borrow, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect.

Some experts have claimed that the type of wood used to create Cremonese violins is responsible for their prized sound, but modern and Cremonese violins are made of the same kinds of wood: maple and spruce. New analysis, however, has revealed unique indications that the wood in the older violins was chemically treated by the makers, leading researchers to suggest that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Cremonese violins probably were not considered superior to other instruments at the time they were made.",
    optionB:
      "B. the sound quality of Cremonese violins results in part from a method the craftspeople used to alter the woo",
    optionC:
      "C. if modern violins were made of a wood other than maple or spruce, they likely would sound as good as Cremonese violins.",
    optionD:
      "D. the current process of making violins is the same process that was used centuries ago by Cremonese craftspeople.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the sound quality of Cremonese and modern violins. The text states that violins made in Cremona in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries sound superior to modern violins. It then indicates that some experts attribute the difference to different woods being used to make these violins, but both Cremonese and modern violins are made of the same woods (maple and spruce); thus this cannot account for the difference. The text then says that recent analysis suggests the wood in Cremonese violins was chemically treated by the craftspeople who made them, thereby providing an alternate explanation for the sound differences: the chemical alteration that is present in the Cremonese violins but absent from the modern ones. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not discuss how the sound quality of Cremonese violins compares with the sound quality of other instruments made during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Instead it focuses on how the sound of the Cremonese violins compares with that of modern violins. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that there are differences in sound quality between the Cremonese and modern violins, and that both types of violin are made with maple or spruce. Thus the type of wood alone does not determine a violin’s sound quality. Furthermore, even if the type of wood alone could account for differences in sound quality, the text makes no mention of other woods, so there is no basis to judge how modern violins would sound if they were made using woods besides maple and spruce. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that there is evidence that Cremonese craftspeople chemically treated the wood used in Cremonese violins. This evidence is attributed to “new analysis,” which strongly suggests that this process was unknown to modern violin makers before that analysis. If the chemical treatment was unknown until recently, the manufacturing process for modern violins must differ with respect to the previously unknown practice of chemically treating the wood.",

According to the text, in service of AACM’s goal to support new works by Black musicians, AACM mentors provide benecial training and guidance to young artists. The text goes on to say that many other art organizations support new artists in similar ways, suggesting that these organizations recognize the importance of providing opportunities for young artists to learn from mentors who are established in their eld. Choice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that technical training is more benecial than creative guidance. The text states that AACM mentors offer both technical training and creative guidance to young artists and that other arts organizations offer similar kinds of support; however, nothing in the text suggests that young artists, or artists of any age, benet more from technical training. Choice C is incorrect because the text is mainly concerned with the fact that established artists are mentoring young artists through AACM and other arts organizations.

      'Choice C is the best answer. "In addition" logically signals that the claim in this sentence—that the Inca of South America may have used quipus to record more complex information—is an additional point related to the previous statement about the Inca using quipus to record countable information. Choice A is incorrect because "as a result" illogically signals that the claim in the sentence is a consequence or result of the previous statement about the Incas using quipus to record countable information. Instead, the possibility that the Inca used quipus to record more complex information is an additional point about how the quipus were used. Choice B is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the claim in the sentence is merely a paraphrase or restatement of the previous statement about the Incas using quipus to record countable information. Instead, the possibility that the Inca used quipus to record more complex information is an additional point about how the quipus were used.

A 2015 study coauthored by Soa Gabriel and Maria da Luz Mathias found that Vikings from Scandinavia may have populated the Azores as early as the ninth century. The researchers found a genetic connection between house mice in the Azores and house mice in Scandinavia. House mice may have traveled from Scandinavia to the Azores on Viking ships. The student wants to specify who may have rst populated the Azores, according to the 2015 study. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",

      "Choice C is the best answer. The rst sentence describes an experience that the viewer has when they’re looking at the photos: they imagine other planets. This sentence describes an experience that the viewer has afterward: the title reminds them that the photos are of frying pans, bringing them back to reality. “Ultimately” is a transition that means “eventually” or “in the end,” so it ts the context perfectly. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The viewer imagining other planets when they’re looking at the photos doesn’t cause the title to bring them back to reality. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates another option or possibility, which doesn’t make sense here.

    optionD: "D. For instance,",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. "As a result" logically signals that the information in the sentence—that, in the US House of Representatives, the entire state of Alaska has just one district—is the result or consequence of Alaska having only about 730,000 people. This is slightly below the average for House districts, which are designed to have roughly equal populations. Choice B is incorrect because "instead" illogically signals that Alaska having just one state district is an alternative to the information about the state’s population in the previous sentence. Rather, the fact that Alaska has just one district is a result or consequence of the entire state having slightly fewer people than an averagesized district. Choice C is incorrect because "nally" illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Alaska having just one district indicates a last step in a process or a concluding summary.

      "In his 1925 book The Morphology of Landscape, US geographer Carl Sauer challenged prevailing views about how natural landscapes inuence human cultures. ______ Sauer argued that instead of being shaped entirely by their natural surroundings, cultures play an active role in their own development by virtue of their interactions with the environment.

      "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: In the early 1960s, the US had a strict national-origins quota system for immigrants. The number of new immigrants allowed from a country each year was based on how many people from that country lived in the US in 1890. This system favored immigrants from northern Europe. Almost 70% of slots were reserved for immigrants from Great Britain, Ireland, and Germany. The 1965 Hart-Celler Act abolished the national-origins quota system.

Betty Acquah is an artist from Ghana who uses pointillism in her work. “By extending dabs of color in the subject matter into the background and vice-versa, an illusion of movement is created,” she says about pointillism. Her work often portrays Ghanaian women, whom she sees as the “unsung heroines of the Ghanaian Republic.” Her pointillist painting “Exquisite” (2016) features ve dancing women twirling their skirts.

However, the differences between the 1881 rst edition and the 1908 edition of his novel A Portrait of a Lady are extreme, even by James’s standards; ______ some critics regard the two editions as two different novels altogether. Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?",
    optionA: "A. by contrast,",
    optionB: "B. in fact,",
    optionC: "C. nevertheless,",
    optionD: "D. in other words,",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. "In fact" logically signals that the critics’ claim at the end of this sentence—that the two editions are essentially two different novels altogether—offers additional emphasis in support of the previous claim that the differences between the editions are extreme. Choice A is incorrect because "by contrast" illogically signals that the claim at the end of this sentence contrasts with the previous claim about the differences between the editions. Instead, the critics’ opinion offers additional emphasis in support of that claim. Choice C is incorrect because "nevertheless" illogically signals that the claim at the end of this sentence is true despite the previous claim about the differences between the two editions. Instead, the critics’ opinion offers additional emphasis in support of that claim. Choice D is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the claim at the end of this sentence is merely paraphrasing the previous claim about the differences between the two editions. The critics’ opinion adds new information to the previous claim rather than simply paraphrasing it.',

    optionC: "C. Granted,",
    optionD: "D. As a result,",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. “Granted” logically signals that the following information—that iconicity is not as highly correlated with acquisition as sign frequency— is true in spite of the information about the correlation between iconicity and acquisition in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect because “in fact” illogically signals that the sentence that follows either emphasizes or refutes the information in the previous sentence regarding the correlation between iconicity and acquisition. Instead, the sentence that follows provides additional information that is true in spite of the preceding information; it neither emphasizes nor refutes that information.

In 2022, a team of researchers studied the presence of thermal inversions in twenty-ve gas giants. Gas giants are planets largely composed of helium and hydrogen. The team found that gas giants featuring a thermal inversion were also likely to contain heat-absorbing metals. One explanation for this relationship is that these metals may reside in a planet’s upper atmosphere, where their absorbed heat causes an increase in temperature.

Using that denition, they determined that Sweden has 24 islands. The student wants to make and support a generalization about nissologists’ denition of an island. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish these goals?",
    optionA:
      "A. The denition of an island as any piece of land surrounded by water is supported by some nissologists, scientists who study islands.",
    optionB:
      "B. Multiple counts of Sweden’s islands have been based on different denitions of an islan",

      "C. Based on a recent count, Sweden has a relatively small number of islands with at least 50 permanent residents.",
    optionD:
      "D. Nissologists’ different denitions can result in huge disparities in counts of islands, as the example of Sweden shows.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The sentence makes a generalization about nissologists’ denition of an island—specically, that the use of one denition rather than another can result in huge disparities in the number of islands counted—and supports that generalization by citing Sweden as an example. Choice A is incorrect. The sentence introduces one denition of an island to an audience unfamiliar with nissologists; it doesn’t make a generalization about nissologists’ denition of an island. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence synthesizes information from the notes about counts of Sweden’s islands, it doesn’t make and support a generalization about nissologists’ denition of an island. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence makes an inference about islands in Sweden; it doesn’t mention nissologists’ denition of an island or make a generalization about it.",

In Greek mythology, Aeolus is the keeper of the winds. Aeolian landforms are created when the wind erodes, transports, or deposits material. A mushroom rock is a rock formation in which the top is wider than the base. A mushroom rock can be formed when the wind erodes the base and the top at different rates. The student wants to provide an explanation and an example of Aeolian landforms. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
    optionA:
      "A. Aeolian landforms are created by different wind-based processes; for example, some are created by wind erosion.",
    optionB:
      "B. Aeolian landforms—landforms created by the wind—include the mushroom rock, a rock formation in which the wind erodes the base of the rock faster than the\ntop.",
    optionC:
      "C. Erosion, transportation, and deposition are three examples of how the wind can create Aeolian landforms and mushroom rocks.",
    optionD:
      "D. A mushroom rock is a rock formation that owes its shape to the wind, a natural force associated with Aeolus in Greek mythology.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. The sentence provides an explanation and an example of Aeolian landforms, explaining that they are landforms created by wind and offering the mushroom rock as an example. Choice A is incorrect. The sentence explains that Aeolian landforms are created by wind but does not provide an example of any specic Aeolian landforms. Rather, the example it provides is of a wind-based process. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence provides a partial explanation of Aeolian landforms, noting that they are created by the wind, it does not effectively provide an example. The sentence seems to indicate that mushroom rocks, rather than being an example of Aeolian landforms, are distinct from them. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence provides an explanation of a mushroom rock, which is a specic example of an Aeolian landform, it doesn’t provide an explanation of Aeolian landforms in general.",

      "Choice B is the best answer. “Nonetheless” is a transition that indicates disagreement. The rst sentence describes the unlikelihood of nding much for critical analysis in Ashbery’s poem (“barren terrain”), while the second sentence describes how Berlant did in fact nd much to analyze in Ashbery’s poem (“fertile ground”), so the transition “nonetheless” ts perfectly. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new but similar idea, which doesn’t make sense here. The idea in this sentence directly contradicts the idea in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect.

      "Arkansas aviator Louise Thaden was already a record breaker when she won the inaugural National Women’s Air Derby, a race from California to Ohio, in August of 1929. ______ in December of 1928, Thaden had set an aviation record when she reached an altitude of 20,269 feet in a Travel Air biplane. Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?",
    optionA: "A. Earlier,",
    optionB: "B. However,",
    optionC: "C. Next,",
    optionD: "D. As a result,",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift back in time. Since the rst sentence talks about Thaden’s race win in 1929 and the second shifts back to talking about her record in 1928, this makes the most sense here. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with and expands on the previous sentence by describing the earlier record that Thaden had "already" held. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift forward in time, which doesn’t make sense here. A record in 1928 didn’t come after Thaden’s race win in 1929. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense in this context—an event in 1929 can’t cause something in 1928.',

    optionC: "C. In other words,",
    optionD: "D. However,",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. "However" logically signals that the information in this sentence about buttery species—that some have colorless, transparent wings —contrasts with the previous information about buttery species with bold, colorful wings. Choice A is incorrect because "similarly" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is similar to the previous information about buttery species. Instead, it contrasts with the previous information. Choice B is incorrect because "previously" illogically signals that this sentence describes an event that occurred before another event.

      "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: Etel Adnan was a Lebanese American poet and artist known for making many leporellos. A leporello is an artist’s book that is folded accordion style. When the book is expanded, the artist’s work is revealed, and its zigzag shape allows it to stand on its own. Her leporello December from My Window (1993) features a panoramic landscape. It is painted using ink and watercolor. The student wants to describe Adnan’s December from My Window to an audience already familiar with leporellos. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
    optionA:
      "A. Featuring a panoramic landscape, the 1993 work is one of Adnan’s many leporellos, which are accordion-style folded books that when expanded reveal the\nartist’s work.",

    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. This choice describes Adnan’s December from My Window in a way that assumes the audience is already familiar with leporellos and focuses on the specic features of the work—its content and medium. Choice A is incorrect. This choice isn’t suited for an audience already familiar with leporellos. A familiar audience wouldn’t need to have the term dened or explained. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t describe Adnan’s December from My Window. It mentions the year and the type of work but not the content or the medium. In addition, it provides a simple denition of leporellos, making this an inappropriate choice for an audience already familiar with leporellos. Choice D is incorrect.

Infrasonic sound is below the range of human hearing, but many animals can hear these sounds from several miles away. Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?",

    optionC: "C. Nowadays,",
    optionD: "D. Similarly,",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. "For this reason" is a cause-and-effect transition. The cause in this case is that the mother elephant wants to know that her calf is safe, so the effect is that she lets out an infrasonic call for the calf to hear. Therefore, "for this reason" ts perfectly in this context. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example of a previous idea. But the second sentence doesn’t provide an example of the events described in the rst sentence. Instead, it describes what happens next: the mother elephant calls for her calf. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift from the past to the current time, which doesn’t make sense here. Both sentences use the present tense, as they’re describing the same time period. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates commonality or agreement between two ideas.

Choice A is incorrect. The sentence indicates who founded the MexiCali Biennial and the years this biennial has taken place; it doesn’t emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials.

To support this claim, the next two sentences compare two examples: one time when there were 180 sunspots and one time when there were only 2 sunspots. So the transition “by comparison” ts perfectly.

Bates was the sole woman to speak, delivering a brief but memorable address to the cheering crowd. The student wants to compare the two women’s contributions to the March on Washington. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
    optionA:
      "A. Hedgeman and Bates contributed to the march in different ways; Bates, for example, delivered a brief but memorable address.",
    optionB:
      "B. Hedgeman worked in politics and helped organize the march, while Bates was a journalist and school desegregation advocate.",
    optionC:
      "C. Although Hedgeman worked behind the scenes to make sure a woman speaker was included, Bates was the sole woman to speak at the march.",
    optionD:
      "D. Many African American women, including Bates and Hedgeman, fought for civil rights, but only one spoke at the march.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. The sentence compares the two women’s contributions to the march: Hedgeman worked behind the scenes to make sure a woman speaker was included, whereas Bates actually spoke at the event. Choice A is incorrect. While it acknowledges that the two women both contributed to the march, it doesn’t indicate what Hedgeman did, so no comparison is made. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence provides information about the two women, it doesn’t mention anything about Bates’s contribution to the march. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence indicates that the two women both fought for civil rights, it doesn’t compare their individual contributions to the march.",

The sentence contrasts Minnesota’s denition of a lake with Wisconsin’s, explaining that Minnesota’s denition (which takes size into account) is more restrictive than Wisconsin’s denition (which doesn’t). Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence notes that Wisconsin’s denition of a lake doesn’t take size into account, it doesn’t contrast Minnesota’s denition with Wisconsin’s. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence states that Wisconsin’s denition of a lake is different from Minnesota’s, but it doesn’t clarify how they differ. In other words, it doesn’t contrast Minnesota’s denition with Wisconsin’s. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence indicates how many lakes Wisconsin has according to Minnesota’s denition of a lake, but it doesn’t clarify how the states’ denitions differ. In other words, it doesn’t contrast Minnesota’s denition with Wisconsin’s.",

The city of Pocatello, Idaho, redesigned its ag after it was named the most poorly designed ag in North America. Pocatello’s new ag better represents the city’s mountainous geography and civic priorities. Residents consider the new ag to be a meaningful symbol of civic pride. The student wants to make and support a generalization about the effect of redesigning a city ag. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",

Following a Gullah technique that originated in West Africa, Dingle skillfully winds a thin palm frond around a bunch of sweetgrass with the help of a “sewing bone” to create the basket’s signature look that no factory can reproduce. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. indicated by",
    optionB: "B. handmade from",
    optionC: "C. represented by",
    optionD: "D. collected with",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Marilyn Dingle’s baskets. In this context, to say that Dingle’s baskets are “handmade from” particular plants means that Dingle creates baskets herself using those plants but without using machines. The text says that Dingle “skillfully winds” parts of palmetto palm plants around sweetgrass plants to make baskets with an appearance that “no factory can reproduce.” This context suggests that Dingle’s baskets are handmade from sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Dingle uses sweetgrass and palmetto palm to create her baskets, not how her baskets are “indicated by,” or signied by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice C is incorrect. Although Dingle’s baskets are described as being made using sweetgrass and palm, there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the baskets are “represented by,” or exemplied or portrayed by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Instead, the focus of the text is on Dingle’s use of sweetgrass and palmetto palm and the impossibility of replicating the appearance of her baskets using machines. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Dingle’s baskets are “collected with,” or brought together in a group with, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Instead, the text describes how Dingle uses those plants to make her baskets.",

In fact, some historians argue that it fundamentally ______ the industry by enabling it to take advantage of mass production methods for the rst time. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. overwhelmed",
    optionB: "B. bypassed",
    optionC: "C. obstructed",
    optionD: "D. transformed",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the invention of the integrated circuit. As used in this context, "transformed" means substantially changed in some way. The text states that the invention radically altered the semiconductor industry, with some historians claiming that it had a fundamental effect on the industry by allowing for mass production for the rst time. This context conveys that the invention of the integrated circuit transformed the semiconductor industry. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the invention of the integrated circuit signicantly affected ("radically altered") the semiconductor industry, it doesn’t indicate that the invention "overwhelmed" the industry, which in this context would mean that it overcame the industry such that the industry struggled or was defeated. Instead, the text conveys that the invention’s effect was positive, since it allowed the semiconductor industry to begin making use of mass production methods. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that the invention of the integrated circuit "bypassed" the semiconductor industry, which would mean it intentionally avoided the industry. The text indicates that the invention directly affected the semiconductor industry, since it made it possible for the industry to begin engaging in mass production methods. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that the invention of the integrated circuit "obstructed" the semiconductor industry, which would mean that it blocked or hindered the industry in some way. Instead, the text indicates that the invention’s effect was positive, since it made it possible for the semiconductor industry to begin engaging in mass production methods.',

      "The following text is adapted from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1837 story “Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment.” The main character, a physician, is experimenting with rehydrating a dried ower. At rst [the rose] lay lightly on the surface of the uid, appearing to imbibe none of its moisture. Soon, however, a singular change began to be visible. The crushed and dried petals stirred and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson, as if the ower were reviving from a deathlike slumber. As used in the text, what does the phrase “a singular” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. A lonely",
    optionB: "B. A disagreeable",
    optionC: "C. An acceptable",
    optionD: "D. An extraordinary",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “singular” most nearly means extraordinary. The text portrays an experiment in which a character rehydrates a dried rose by infusing it with moisture. After prolonged contact with the liquid, the rose begins to absorb it, undergoing an exceptional transformation: its color deepens, its previously “crushed and dried” petals shift, and the entire ower revives “from a deathlike slumber.” In other words, an extraordinary change is visible in the ower. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts “singular” can mean of or relating to an individual or to a single instance of something, this usage doesn’t imply loneliness or an otherwise unsatisfactory condition of isolation. Moreover, the text doesn’t attribute such a condition to the rose. Choice B is incorrect. Although “singular” has several related meanings, none of them relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant. Moreover, the text doesn’t portray the change undergone by the rose as necessarily disagreeable. Choice C is incorrect because “singular” means extraordinary, not acceptable. The change is portrayed as striking, not barely satisfactory.",

      "Rejecting the premise that the literary magazine Ebony and Topaz (1927) should present a unied vision of Black American identity, editor Charles S. Johnson fostered his contributors’ diverse perspectives by promoting their authorial autonomy. Johnson’s self-effacement diverged from the editorial stances of W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain Locke, whose decisions for their publications were more ______. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. procient",
    optionB: "B. dogmatic",
    optionC: "C. ambiguous",
    optionD: "D. unpretentious",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. A person who is "dogmatic" believes strongly that their principles and opinions are true. Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one "unied vision" of Black American identity that they prioritize over the "diverse perspectives" of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic. Choice A is incorrect. "Procient" means "skilled." Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different styles; they’re not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. "Ambiguous" means "unclear" or "open to multiple interpretations." However, it’s actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations ("diverse perspectives"). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to "diverge" from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and rm (a "unied vision"). Choice D is incorrect. "Unpretentious" means "not trying to impress others with greater skill or importance than is actually possessed." Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson is pretentious (trying to impress others).',

    question:
      "“How lifelike are they?” Many computer animators prioritize this question as they strive to create ever more realistic environments and lighting. Generally, while characters in computer-animated lms appear highly exaggerated, environments and lighting are carefully engineered to mimic reality. But some animators, such as Pixar’s Sanjay Patel, are focused on a different question. Rather than asking rst whether the environments and lighting they’re creating are convincingly lifelike, Patel and others are asking whether these elements reect their lms’ unique stories. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole?",
    optionA:
      "A. It reects a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce.",
    optionB:
      "B. It represents a concern of computer animators who are more interested in creating unique backgrounds and lighting effects than realistic ones.",
    optionC:
      "C. It conveys the uncertainty among many computer animators about how to create realistic animations using current technology.",
    optionD:
      "D. It illustrates a reaction that audiences typically have to the appearance of characters created by computer animators.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole. The text begins with the underlined question, “How lifelike are they?” The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated lms, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren’t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reect the lm’s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reect lms’ unique stories and aren’t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience’s reactions to characters in animated lms.",

Because these sensations are linked to a chemical component (for example, the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain when one receives or expects a reward), they can be said to have a partly physiological basis. These processes have been described in mammals, but Jingnan Huang and his colleagues have recently observed that some behaviors of honeybees (such as foraging) are also motivated by a dopamine-based signaling process.

      "D. It presents research showing that certain insects and mammals behave similarly when there is a possibility of a reward for their actions.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to summarize a nding suggesting that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects resemble mechanisms in mammalian brains. The text begins by explaining that feelings such as pleasure and displeasure are linked to chemical processes in the brain, such as the release of dopamine when one receives a reward. The text then indicates that such processes have been seen in mammals but that researchers have recently observed similar processes involving dopamine in honeybees. Taken together, this information serves to sum up the discovery that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects may resemble mechanisms linked to feelings such as pleasure and displeasure in mammals. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe any experiments or experimental methods. Instead, the text describes a phenomenon that has been observed in mammals and then presents the recent observations of Huang and colleagues that this phenomenon is also seen in honeybees. Choice B is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that certain insects can express how they’re feeling through particular processes. The text does indicate that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine, but it doesn’t suggest that these behaviors enable honeybees to communicate feelings or sensations. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents research showing that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine and therefore may be motivated by similar mechanisms to those in mammalian brains, not that honeybees and mammals behave similarly when there is the possibility of reward for their actions.",

    optionB: "B. evaluated",
    optionC: "C. determined",
    optionD: "D. acquired",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how the ow of information between two regions of the brain may affect the ease of people’s decision making. In this context, "reduced" means decreased. The text presents the nding from a team of neuroeconomists that decision making may be connected to communication between the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. In presenting this nding, the text suggests a contrast between people who tend to be more decisive and people who make decisions more slowly. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the ow of information between the two brain regions is intensied, or strengthened. On the other hand, this context suggests that people make choices more slowly when the ow of information between the two brain regions is decreased. Choice B is incorrect because "evaluated" means assessed, which wouldn’t make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the ow of information between two brain regions is intensied, or strengthened. This suggests that people’s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to assess the information. Choice C is incorrect because "determined" means judged or inuenced, neither of which would make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the ow of information between two brain regions is intensied, or strengthened. This suggests that people’s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to judge or inuence the information. Choice D is incorrect because "acquired" means developed or attained, neither of which would make sense in context.

    optionA: "A. surmised",
    optionB: "B. contrived",
    optionC: "C. questioned",
    optionD: "D. regretted",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century household food purchases. In this context, “surmised” means formed an idea or assumption with little evidence. The text explains that certain economic historians “assumed” that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, “contrived” would mean brought about or created through trickery. Nothing in the text suggests that the economic historians were deliberately trying to trick people with a claim about food purchasing behaviors in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households; the text simply suggests that they made an assumption about those behaviors that another historian believes isn’t supported by the available data. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that it’s Logan and not the economic historians who “questioned,” or doubted, the assumption that large and small households in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries spent different amounts on food per person; the economic historians are the ones who made that assumption to begin with. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians “regretted,” or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households. The text focuses on the idea that the economic historians made an assumption about those behaviors that may not be supported by available data, not on the historians’ emotional response to what households did in the past.",

    optionD: "D. Interrupted",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, “disturbed” most nearly means alarmed. The text portrays the narrator traveling in a carriage as wolves howl in the surrounding darkness. The text contrasts the reaction of both the narrator and the horses pulling the carriage with that of the driver of the carriage: the narrator and horses are “dreadfully afraid,” but the driver is “not in the least disturbed.” In other words, the driver is not alarmed by the wolves nearby. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean disorganized, the text doesn’t portray a character acting in a disorganized manner; instead, the driver continues to drive the carriage, even though the horses pulling it are alarmed. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean offended, the text doesn’t portray one character feeling offended, or upset, by another’s actions; instead, it contrasts the fear felt by the narrator with another character’s lack of fear.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence of the text states that Shakti knows the woods she is walking in well. The next sentence, which is underlined, emphasizes Shakti’s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods by describing how the tree branches are friendly and “welcoming,” as they are depicted as extending open arms to her. The remainder of the text also shows that Shakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as “an old friend” of the trees. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to emphasize Shakti’s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits. Choice A is incorrect because the text and underlined portion suggest that Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, in her surroundings: the trees around her are described as welcoming and reassuring. Moreover, the underlined portion discusses Shakti’s feelings in the forest, not the river, since she hasn’t reached the river yet. Choice B is incorrect because the text and underlined portion emphasize Shakti’s familiarity with the woods. The trees are inviting, and she feels like “an old friend” to the woods, so she isn’t lost or confused there.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the signicance of the 2014 archaeological nding at El Algar. In this context, “concede” means to admit something is true after rst resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe “Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.” But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included “valuable objects signaling a high position of power,” which would raise the possibility that “women may have also held leadership roles.” Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion. Choice A is incorrect because “waive” means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn’t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text. Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the nding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, “refute” means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team’s nding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “require” means to demand or specify as mandatory.

      "D. To explain a study’s conclusion and how a research team arrived at that conclusion",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain a study’s conclusion and how researchers involved in the study arrived at that conclusion. The text begins by summarizing the main conclusion of the study conducted by Paul Hanel and colleagues: when confronted with ideas they disagree with in discussions about controversial topics, people are more likely to respond politely if they think about their personal values before engaging in such discussions. The text then goes on to describe the design of Hanel and colleagues’ experiment. By comparing interactions between members of an experimental group (who had been prompted to write about their personal values beforehand) to those between members of a control group (who had been prompted to write about a beverage), the team found that people in the experimental group behaved more civilly, or politely, than people in the control group did during discussions about a controversial topic. This nding led to the conclusion described at the beginning of the text. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses the results of a study, it doesn’t provide any indication that the conclusion the study supported—that when facing disagreement, people behave more politely when they have thought about their values—is a belief that is widely held.

    question:
      "Early in the Great Migration of 1910–1970, which involved the mass migration of Black people from the southern to the northern United States, political activist and Chicago Defender writer Fannie Barrier Williams was instrumental in helping other Black women establish themselves in the North. Many women hoped for better employment opportunities in the North because, in the South, they faced much competition for domestic employment and men tended to get agricultural work. To aid with this transition, Barrier Williams helped secure job placement in the North for many women before they even began their journey. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To introduce and illustrate Barrier Williams’s integral role in supporting other Black women as their circumstances changed during part of the Great Migration",
    optionB:
      "B. To establish that Barrier Williams used her professional connections to arrange employment for other Black women, including jobs with the Chicago Defender",
    optionC:
      "C. To demonstrate that the factors that motivated the start of the Great Migration were different for Black women than they were for Black men",
    optionD:
      "D. To provide an overview of the employment challenges faced by Black women in the agricultural and domestic spheres in the southern United States",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the text’s purpose, which is to discuss the important role Barrier Williams played in supporting many other Black women as they relocated to the northern United States during the early years of the Great Migration. After introducing Barrier Williams, the text describes how she helped nd jobs for other Black women, who in many cases relocated in search of better employment prospects than the South could offer at the time. The text indicates that by doing so, she eased these women’s transition as their circumstances changed. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions Barrier Williams’s work as a political activist and writer for the Chicago Defender, it doesn’t discuss any professional connections she made in these roles or indicate that she used any such connections in her work to secure employment for other Black women. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text discusses a factor that caused many women to relocate during the Great Migration, their diculty nding employment in the South, the text doesn’t indicate that this factor motivated the start of the Great Migration. Moreover, the text doesn’t discuss the factors that motivated Black men to migrate. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions the dicult employment prospects for Black women in the domestic and agricultural sectors in the South during the Great Migration, the text’s main purpose isn’t to provide an overview of the employment challenges Black women faced in these sectors. Rather, it provides this information to show that Barrier Williams played a crucial role in supporting many Black women who relocated to the North by helping them achieve one of their main goals, securing a job.",

    question:
      "Text 1 In 1916, H. Dugdale Sykes disputed claims that The Two Noble Kinsmen was coauthored by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher. Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious—Fletcher had a distinct style in his other plays, so much so that lines with that style were considered sucient evidence of Fletcher’s authorship. But for the lines not deemed to be by Fletcher, Sykes felt that their depiction of women indicated that their author was not Shakespeare but Philip Massinger. Text 2 Scholars have accepted The Two Noble Kinsmen as coauthored by Shakespeare since the 1970s: it appears in all major one-volume editions of Shakespeare’s complete works. Though scholars disagree about who wrote what exactly, it is generally held that on the basis of style, Shakespeare wrote all of the rst act and most of the last, while John Fletcher authored most of the three middle acts. Based on the texts, both Sykes in Text 1 and the scholars in Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?",
    optionA:
      "A. John Fletcher’s writing has a unique, readily identiable style.",
    optionB:
      "B. The women characters in John Fletcher’s plays are similar to the women characters in Philip Massinger’s plays.",
    optionC:
      "C. The Two Noble Kinsmen belongs in one-volume compilations of Shakespeare’s complete plays.",
    optionD:
      "D. Philip Massinger’s style in the rst and last acts of The Two Noble Kinsmen is an homage to Shakespeare’s style.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. Text 1 states that Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious because he had a distinct style in his other plays. Text 2 states that scholars generally agree “on the basis of style” that Fletcher wrote most of the three middle acts. Both texts imply that Fletcher’s writing has a unique, readily identiable style that can be used to distinguish his work from others. Choice B is incorrect. While Text 1 refers to the women in Massinger plays, neither text compares the women of Fletcher’s plays to the women of Massinger’s plays. Text 2 doesn’t mention Massinger at all. Choice C is incorrect. Text 1 states that Sykes disputed that Shakespeare coauthored the play, and implied that it was coauthored by Fletcher and Massinger instead. Sykes, therefore, would disagree that The Two Noble Kinsmen belongs in a Shakespeare compilation. Choice D is incorrect. Text 1 doesn’t suggest that Massinger was inspired by Shakespeare, and Text 2 doesn’t mention Massinger at all.",

      "The following text is adapted from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1844 short story “Drowne’s Wooden Image.” Drowne, a young man, is carving a wooden gure to decorate the front of a ship. Day by day, the work assumed greater precision, and settled its irregular and misty outline into distincter grace and beauty. The general design was now obvious to the common eye. As used in the text, what does the word “assumed” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Acquired",
    optionB: "B. Acknowledged",
    optionC: "C. Imitated",
    optionD: "D. Speculated",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “assumed” most nearly means acquired, or came to possess. The text portrays a character named Drowne carving a gure out of wood. At rst “irregular and misty,” or haphazard and indistinct, the gure’s outline gradually showed “distincter grace and beauty” until the general design of the carved object “was now obvious to the common eye,” or plainly recognizable to anyone. In other words, as Drowne continued to carve, the wooden object came to possess, or acquired, greater precision, changing from an indistinct outline or shape into a graceful, beautiful, and clearly recognizable form. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “assumed” can mean acknowledged, or recognized, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden gure can’t acknowledge its own precision. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wooden gure merely imitated, or mimicked, precision. Rather, the text suggests that as Drowne carved his wooden gure, it gradually became more precise. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “assumed” can mean speculated, or supposed based on incomplete information, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden gure can’t speculate about its own precision.",

      "The works of Chicana artist Ester Hernandez are now ______ in museums both in the United States and abroad, but the murals she contributed to as a member of Las Mujeres Muralistas early in her artistic career were displayed in outdoor public spaces across San Francisco. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. invented",
    optionB: "B. adjusted",
    optionC: "C. featured",
    optionD: "D. recommended",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ester Hernandez’s art. In this context, "featured" means shown prominently. The text focuses on where Hernandez’s works have been and continue to be displayed, explaining that her early works, which consisted of murals, could be viewed in outdoor spaces in San Francisco. The central contrast developed in the text is between where her early works could be viewed and where her works can be viewed now, which is in museums across the United States and around the world. The context therefore supports the idea that Hernandez’s works are now shown, or featured, in museums globally. Choice A is incorrect because in this context "invented" would mean created something for the rst time, which isn’t supported since the text doesn’t discuss where Hernandez creates her works or whether they’re original or innovative. Choice B is incorrect because "adjusted" in this context would mean adapted. Although the text mentions that many of Hernandez’s early works were outdoor murals and thus it may be reasonable to infer that Hernandez altered her approach to creating art so that her works could be displayed in indoor venues instead, the text makes no mention of how Hernandez’s works might have been adapted for such venues. The text focuses on where Hernandez’s works have been and continue to be displayed, not on how she or anyone else may have adapted, or adjusted, her works. Choice D is incorrect because "recommended" in this context would mean endorsed or put forth as a suggestion for something that is worth seeing. Although it may be reasonable to say that in choosing to display certain works, museum curators believe such works are worth seeing, the text doesn’t discuss the reasons why museums display Hernandez’s works. Instead, the text mainly develops a contrast between where Hernandez’s early works could once be viewed and where her work can be viewed now.',

    question:
      "Studying late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century artifacts from an agricultural and domestic site in Texas, archaeologist Ayana O. Flewellen found that Black women employed as farm workers utilized hook-and-eye closures to fasten their clothes at the waist, giving themselves a silhouette similar to the one that was popular in contemporary fashion and typically achieved through more restrictive garments such as corsets. Flewellen argues that this sartorial practice shows that these women balanced hegemonic ideals of femininity with the requirements of their physically demanding occupation. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To describe an unexpected discovery that altered a researcher’s view of how rapidly fashions among Black female farmworkers in late nineteenth- and early\ntwentieth-century Texas changed during the period",

The text provides an overview of a scholarly work discussing the fashion practices of Black female farmworkers in late 19th- and early 20th-century Texas, and how these practices were inuenced by both the fashion ideals of the time and the demands of farmwork. Choice A is incorrect. The text never discusses the rate of fashion change among Black female farmworkers. The text also never categorizes Flewellen’s ndings as "unexpected." Choice B is incorrect. The text actually explains that Black female farmworkers were trying to achieve traditional feminine ideals, not resist them. Choice C is incorrect.

Astrophysicist Sarana El-Badry Nance and colleagues recently investigated whether acoustic waves in the star could be used to determine internal stellar states but concluded that this method could not suciently reveal Betelgeuse’s internal characteristics to allow its evolutionary state to be rmly xed.

    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the second sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence establishes something astronomers believe with some certainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a supernova. The second sentence then introduces a problem: astronomers aren’t certain when Betelgeuse will explode because they don’t have enough information about the star’s internal characteristics. Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarana El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse’s internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn’t be sucient. Thus, the function of the second sentence is to identify the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but didn’t. Choice A is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not a serious limitation of how Nance and colleagues tried to solve it. It is the third sentence that introduces Nance and colleagues, but no serious limitation of their approach to studying a method of determining internal stellar states is described. Choice B is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not the central nding they ultimately reported. It is the third sentence that presents Nance and colleagues’ conclusion that a potential method for determining internal stellar states would be insucient. Choice D is incorrect because the second sentence doesn’t indicate how other astronomers or astrophysicists responded to the work done by Nance and colleagues; the text doesn’t address this information at all.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ochoa’s prediction that humans will one day need to live in places other than Earth. As used in this context, “speculates” would mean puts forward an idea without rm evidence. The text states that Ochoa “doesn’t have a denite idea” about when humans might need to live in other environments and characterizes Ochoa’s prediction as a “conjecture,” or a conclusion presented without convincing evidence.

    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the W boson. In this context, "scale" means size or extent. The text indicates that recent measurements of the W boson were remarkable because they revealed the subatomic particle’s mass to be much greater ("seven standard deviations higher") than had been expected based on a standard model.

      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Renata Flores Rivera’s use of Quechua in her music. In this context, “inexperienced with” means not accustomed to. The text indicates that Flores Rivera wanted to promote the Quechua language in her music and overcame a challenge by seeking help with pronunciation from her grandmother and by taking language classes.

    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Sterlin Harjo’s approach to representing Native characters on television. As used in this context, “repudiates” means rejects or refuses to have anything to do with. The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo’s series Reservation Dogs focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a “rejection” of the typical approach to depicting Native characters. This context thus indicates that Harjo repudiates television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes Harjo’s “rejection” of the typical approach to representing Native characters on television, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo “proclaims,” or declares or arms, television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. Harjo is described as refusing to follow the pattern of depicting Native characters in the distant past, not as proclaiming that pattern. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes television’s tendency to represent Native characters in the distant past as something that is already occurring, not as something that Harjo “foretells,” or predicts will happen in the future. The text is focused on Harjo’s “rejection” of this pattern, not on any predictions he may have about it. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Harjo “recants” something would mean that he withdraws a previously held belief, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo recants television’s tendency to represent Native characters as living in the past. No beliefs previously held by Harjo are mentioned. Additionally, a tendency isn’t a belief and thus isn’t something that can be recanted.",

Thus, the text’s emphasis on the zoo’s size suggests that the zoo extended, or stretched, over a large area of land. Choice A is incorrect because if the zoo covers “numberless acres,” then it could not reasonably be described as hidden, or concealed from view. Choice B is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the zoo was discussed, or talked about. Rather, the text focuses on the zoo’s large size. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “spread” can mean coated, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because to coat something means to apply a thin layer of a liquid substance, such as oil or paint, to a surface. Therefore, it would not be accurate to say that the zoo coated the acres on which it sits.",

A ______ viburnum plant, on the other hand, will have leaves with smooth surfaces and uniformly green coloration. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. struggling",
    optionB: "B. benecial",
    optionC: "C. simple",
    optionD: "D. healthy",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of damage to viburnum plants. In this context, “healthy” would mean not distressed or diseased. The text states that insect damage may cause viburnum plants to be discolored and have abnormal growths. In the next sentence, the phrase “on the other hand” indicates a contrast with the description of plants suffering from damage. Thus, the context contrasts the appearance of healthy, undamaged plants with the appearance of damaged plants. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “struggling” would mean working against diculties. The text rst describes viburnum plants experiencing damage by insects, and the phrase “on the other hand” then establishes a contrast with that description. It wouldn’t make sense to contrast struggling viburnum plants with those being damaged by insects, because in both cases the plants would be experiencing diculties. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “benecial” would mean producing good or helpful effects. The text doesn’t discuss how viburnum plants affect other things or suggest that the plants are helpful in some way; rather, it focuses on how viburnum plants are affected by certain conditions. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “simple” would mean plain or uncomplicated. The text doesn’t discuss whether certain viburnum plants are complicated or uncomplicated; rather, it focuses on how viburnum plants are affected by certain conditions.",

When the Moon was still forming, its surface was softer, and asteroid or meteoroid impacts would have left less of an impression; thus, evidence of early impacts may no longer be present. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. reect",
    optionB: "B. receive",
    optionC: "C. evaluate",
    optionD: "D. mimic",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Moon’s surface. In this context, “reect” means show or make apparent. The text states that because the surface of the Moon was softer when the Moon was still forming than it is now, early asteroid and meteoroid impacts “would have left less of an impression” and, as a result, evidence of them may no longer exist. This context supports the idea that the surface of the Moon may not accurately show signs of early impact events. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately “receive,” or acquire or experience, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids. The text indicates that the impacts have already occurred, and it isn’t clear how the Moon’s surface could be accurate or inaccurate in experiencing them. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately “evaluate,” or determine the signicance or condition of, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids, since that would suggest that it’s possible for the Moon’s surface to make a decision of any kind. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “mimic” would mean to deliberately simulate or closely imitate something. It wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately mimic early asteroid and meteoroid impacts, since that would suggest that it’s possible for the Moon to deliberately imitate something.",

    optionC: "C. Developed",
    optionD: "D. Settled",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “contracted” most nearly means developed. The text explains that Mr. Brooke has a “too rambling habit of mind,” which the text likens to a disease, saying he is thought to have contracted it. To contract a disease means to acquire or develop a disease. In other words, the text indicates that Mr. Brooke is believed to have acquired, or developed, the habit of mind described in the text. Choice A is incorrect. Although “contracted” can mean limited or restricted in some contexts, here Mr. Brooke is said to draw unpredictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this “too rambling habit of mind,” not that it has been somehow limited or restricted. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text describes Mr. Brooke’s habit of mind, nothing suggests that those are his descriptions or, indeed, that he described his habit of mind at all.

But physicist Aymeric Roux and colleagues discovered ways to mitigate these factors, resulting in bubbles that can last for a year or more. For example, glycerol tends to adhere to water molecules, so a bubble with a shell that contains both water and glycerol is able to draw additional water molecules from the surrounding air and thereby compensate for evaporation.

      "D. It mentions a method discussed in the text that researchers intend to test in future experiments.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it describes how the underlined portion of the sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text begins by discussing ordinary soap bubbles, objects that usually exist for less than a minute before popping due to either evaporation or gravity-induced drainage. The text then goes on to mention work by researchers Aymeric Roux and colleagues, who have discovered how to increase the longevity of bubbles by altering their chemical composition. Finally, the underlined portion of the text describes how this process works: since the bubble contains both water and glycerol, it can draw water molecules from the surrounding air to replace those lost to evaporation. Therefore, the underlined portion of the sentence describes the effects of a process devised by researchers that increases the longevity of an object described in the text. Choice B is incorrect because the circumstance that prompted the research is discussed in the rst sentence of the text, not the underlined portion.

    optionC: "C. compelling",
    optionD: "D. indecipherable",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of Octavia Butler’s career. In this context, “impenetrable” means impossible to enter. The text indicates that the eld of science ction was dominated by white males when Butler, a Black woman, started writing, but she published several science ction short stories and a novel and later won a prestigious award; that is, Butler pursued science ction writing and had success. This context suggests that Butler didn’t view the genre as impossible to enter. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, “legitimate” would mean genuinely good or valid. Nothing in the text suggests that Butler didn’t think the science ction genre was good or valid; in fact, it indicates that she pursued and made a successful career of publishing work in that eld. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, “compelling” would mean attracting or demanding attention.

    optionA: "A. recognizable",
    optionB: "B. fragile",
    optionC: "C. common",
    optionD: "D. sophisticated",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of noses on ancient sculptures. In this context, "fragile" means weak or delicate. This matches the text’s description of noses on ancient sculptures, which are often missing from sculptures’ heads because they are "especially easy to break." Therefore, this context indicates that noses on ancient sculptures are the most fragile part of the sculptures’ heads. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "recognizable" would mean identiable, and since the text indicates that noses are often missing from ancient statues, they therefore cannot be the most recognizable part of the statue. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many ancient statues are missing noses, so noses wouldn’t be "common," or frequent, aspects of ancient statues; they would conversely be uncommon. Choice D is incorrect because the text only indicates that noses on ancient statues often stick out and end up missing from the heads, which doesn’t relate to the noses being "sophisticated," or knowledgeable or rened.',

      "Text 1 Growth in the use of novel nanohybrids—materials created from the conjugation of multiple distinct nanomaterials, such as iron oxide and gold nanomaterials conjugated for use in magnetic imaging—has outpaced studies of nanohybrids’ environmental risks. Unfortunately, risk evaluations based on nanohybrids’ constituents are not reliable: conjugation may alter constituents’ physiochemical properties such that innocuous nanomaterials form a nanohybrid that is anything but. Text 2 The potential for enhanced toxicity of nanohybrids relative to the toxicity of constituent nanomaterials has drawn deserved attention, but the effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case. For instance, it was recently shown that a nanohybrid of silicon dioxide and zinc oxide preserved the desired optical transparency of zinc oxide nanoparticles while mitigating the nanoparticles’ potential to damage DNA. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assertion in the underlined portion of Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By concurring that the risk described in Text 1 should be evaluated but emphasizing that the risk is more than offset by the potential benets of nanomaterial\nconjugation",
    optionB:
      "B. By arguing that the situation described in Text 1 may not be representative but conceding that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation are harder to predict than\nresearchers had expected",
    optionC:
      "C. By denying that the circumstance described in Text 1 is likely to occur but acknowledging that many aspects of nanomaterial conjugation are still poorly\nunderstood",
    optionD:
      "D. By agreeing that the possibility described in Text 1 is a cause for concern but pointing out that nanomaterial conjugation does not inevitably produce that result",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 acknowledges that nanohybrids may be more toxic than their constituent parts, but also provides an example of a nanohybrid that has reduced toxicity compared to its components: silicon dioxide and zinc oxide together have all the benets of zinc oxide nanoparticles without any of the DNA harm zinc oxide has on its own. Choice A is incorrect. While the author of Text 2 gives an example of a nanohybrid that isn’t as toxic as its constituent parts, they don’t argue that the benet outweighs the risk. They merely argue that “the effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case.” Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 states that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation “vary by case,” and that the attention that their potential toxicity has drawn is warranted. If the situation in Text 1 weren’t representative, then there would be less attention to the potential danger of these materials. Furthermore, neither passage suggests that researchers had expected that they could predict the effects of nanomaterial conjugation. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 agrees that the potential toxicity of nanohybrids “has drawn deserved attention,” so they aren’t denying the problem.",

    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to show that while Jane calmly goes about her daily tasks, she is experiencing internal agitation about possibly seeking a new job. At the start of the text, Jane says, “I went on with my day’s business tranquilly,” indicating that she is outwardly calm. This outward calmness is then contrasted with her intense internal restlessness, as Jane says that thoughts of leaving her job keep running through her mind, that she is “involuntarily framing advertisements” (meaning that she can’t stop herself from thinking up potential listings for jobs), and that she often wonders what new “situations” (or jobs) would be like. Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of Jane’s feelings, either positive or negative, about the people she works for at Thorneld Hall. And rather than emphasizing that Jane feels particularly loyal to her employers, the text focuses on her constant consideration of leaving her job. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Jane nds her current situation fullling, or satisfying.

      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ulysses Jenkins’s video art. As used in this context, “newfound” means recently discovered or established. The text indicates that in the 1970s, video cameras became cheaper and therefore more widely available than they had been in the past. The text goes on to say that this development provided Jenkins and other artists with capabilities that they previously didn’t have.

Choice C is incorrect because “inevitable” means impossible to avoid, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text doesn’t discuss the likelihood of artists, or anyone else, gaining access to video cameras. Choice D is incorrect because “habitual” means doing something regularly or repeatedly. Although the text does suggest that Jenkins created multiple pieces of video art, its focus is on the fact that video cameras had only just become widely available to artists in the 1970s.

Using a climate-vegetation model, the team concluded that the end of the region’s humid period occurred 500 years earlier than previously assumed.

      "Choice A is the best answer. Brierley et al.’s research directly challenges Wright’s claim that pastoralism turned the Sahara into a desert, suggesting that, in a Sahara that turned arid 500 years earlier than previously thought, pastoral practices may have actually “preserved vegetation” rather than depleting it. Choice B is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research actually disputes the idea that any Neolithic peoples’ behaviors, including pastoralism, could have contributed to the Sahara’s changing climate. In fact, their research implies that the Neolithic peoples’ practices did not “exacerbate aridity” (i.e., make things worse), but may have slowed environmental changes. Choice C is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research does not acknowledge that pastoralism can have deleterious (i.e., negative) effects on a region’s vegetation and climate. It only describes one possible benecial effect: preserving vegetation through practices like selective grazing. Choice D is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research does not call for more research into factors that likely contributed to the desertication of the Sahara region.",

      "Yawn contagion occurs when one individual yawns in response to another’s yawn. Studies of this behavior in primates have focused on populations in captivity, but biologist Elisabetta Palagi and her colleagues have shown that it can occur in wild primate populations as well. In their study, which focused on a wild population of gelada monkeys (Theropithecus gelada) in Ethiopia, the researchers further reported that yawn contagion most commonly occurred in males and across different social groups instead of within a single social group. Which choice best describes the function of the rst sentence in the text as a whole?",
    optionA: "A. It denes a phenomenon that is discussed in the text.",
    optionB: "B. It introduces a problem that is examined in the text.",
    optionC: "C. It makes a claim that is challenged in the text.",
    optionD: "D. It presents a hypothesis that is evaluated in the text.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the rst sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence introduces what yawn contagion is, explaining that it occurs when an individual yawns in response to the yawn of another individual. The text goes on to describe Elisabetta Palagi and her colleagues’ study of this phenomenon in a wild population of gelada monkeys. According to the text, the study showed that wild primate populations experience yawn contagion and that the behavior occurs most commonly in male monkeys and across social groups. Thus, the function of the rst sentence is to dene the phenomenon of yawn contagion that is discussed in the text. Choice B is incorrect. Although the rst sentence introduces the text’s discussion of yawn contagion, it doesn’t present this behavior, or anything else, as a problem. Choice C is incorrect because the rst sentence doesn’t present a claim but instead explains what yawn contagion is. Moreover, the text doesn’t challenge anything; it’s an informative text that describes the ndings of a research study about yawning in wild primate populations. Choice D is incorrect.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. awkward",
    optionB: "B. imaginative",
    optionC: "C. manageable",
    optionD: "D. competent",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of self-control in cuttlesh. In this context, "competent" means capable. The text describes a study in which cuttlesh demonstrated an ability to exercise restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of eating a meal that was already available to them. That is, by delaying gratication, the cuttlesh in the study demonstrated that they were capable of, or competent at, exercising self-control. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that in demonstrating self-control, cuttlesh are "awkward," or lacking skill or grace. If anything, the text indicates that cuttlesh appear to be surprisingly skilled at exercising self-control. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "imaginative" would mean creative, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that cuttlesh demonstrate creativity. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that cuttlesh seem to be capable of exercising restraint and self-control. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "manageable" would mean capable of being controlled. Although the text indicates that the cuttlesh in the study demonstrated restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of devouring a readily available meal (which suggests their ability to control themselves), it doesn’t suggest that cuttlesh are thus also able to be managed or controlled by others.',

      "Text 1 Soy sauce, made from fermented soybeans, is noted for its umami avor. Umami—one of the ve basic tastes along with sweet, bitter, salty, and sour—was formally classied when its taste receptors were discovered in the 2000s. In 2007, to dene the pure umami avor scientists Rie Ishii and Michael O’Mahony used broths made from shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed, and two panels of Japanese and US judges closely agreed on a description of the taste. Text 2 A 2022 experiment by Manon Jünger et al. led to a greater understanding of soy sauce’s avor prole. The team initially presented a mixture of compounds with low molecular weights to taste testers who found it was not as salty or bitter as real soy sauce. Further analysis of soy sauce identied proteins, including dipeptides, that enhanced umami avor and also contributed to saltiness. The team then made a mix of 50 chemical compounds that re-created soy sauce’s avor. Based on the texts, if Ishii and O’Mahony (Text 1) and Jünger et al. (Text 2) were aware of the ndings of both experiments, they would most likely agree with which statement?",
    optionA:
      "A. On average, the diets of people in the United States tend to have fewer foods that contain certain dipeptides than the diets of people in Japan have.",
    optionB:
      "B. Chemical compounds that activate both the umami and salty taste receptors tend to have a higher molecular weight than those that only activate umami taste\nreceptors.",
    optionC:
      "C. Fermentation introduces proteins responsible for the increase of umami avor in soy sauce, and those proteins also increase the perception of saltiness.",
    optionD:
      "D. The broths in the 2007 experiment most likely did not have a substantial amount of the dipeptides that played a key part in the 2022 experiment.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. Ishii and O’Mahony were trying to isolate the pure umami avor, while Jünger was trying to recreate soy sauce, which has a mix of avors that includes umami. Accordingly, the broths from Text 1 are not described as having any soy sauce in them—just “shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed.” So they probably don’t have as much of the dipeptides described in Text 2, which were found to be a key part of soy sauce’s umami-ness and its saltiness. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Neither text gets into the diets of people in the United States, nor the diets of people in Japan. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Text 2 does talk about the molecular weights of chemical compounds, but there isn’t enough information provided about molecular weights in Text 1 to make an inference about what the scientists in Text 1 would say. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text supports this.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. accuracy",
    optionB: "B. inactivity",
    optionC: "C. complexity",
    optionD: "D. restraint",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Olga Tokarczuk’s novel The Books of Jacob. As used in this context, “complexity” means having many complicated parts that when taken as a whole are dicult to follow or explain. The text indicates that The Books of Jacob has a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is dicult to follow), and reverse page numbering. Together, these features make up a novel that’s challenging to read and summarize. This context supports the idea that a brief book review can’t do justice to the novel’s complexity. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word “accuracy,” or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be used to describe a novel, the text doesn’t discuss whether Tokarczuk’s novel has this quality. Instead, the text describes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a dicult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering. These features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because “inactivity” means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text describes Tokarczuk’s novel, and although it’s possible the novel could portray its characters as inactive, it wouldn’t make sense to describe the novel itself as such. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “restraint” would mean holding back or showing self-control, and the text doesn’t indicate that Tokarczuk’s novel has either of these qualities. In fact, the features of the novel that the text describes, such as a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot, and reverse page numbering, suggest excess and complexity, not restraint.",

      "Text 1 Microbes are tiny organisms in the soil, water, and air all around us. They thrive even in very harsh conditions. That’s why Noah Fierer and colleagues were surprised when soil samples they collected from an extremely cold, dry area in Antarctica didn’t seem to contain any life. The nding doesn’t prove that there are no microbes in that area, but the team says it does suggest that the environment severely restricts microbes’ survival. Text 2 Microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth. So it’s unlikely they would be completely absent from Fierer’s team’s study site, no matter how extreme the environment is. There were probably so few organisms in the samples that current technology couldn’t detect them. But since a spoonful of typical soil elsewhere might contain billions of microbes, the presence of so few in the Antarctic soil samples would show how challenging the conditions are. Based on the texts, Fierer’s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about microbes?",
    optionA:
      "A. Most microbes are better able to survive in environments with extremely dry conditions than in environments with harsh temperatures.",
    optionB:
      "B. A much higher number of microbes would probably be found if another sample of soil were taken from the Antarctic study site.",
    optionC:
      "C. Microbes are likely dicult to detect in the soil at the Antarctic study site because they tend to be smaller than microbes found in typical soil elsewhere.",
    optionD:
      "D. Most microbes are probably unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer’s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer’s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn’t appear to contain any life. Fierer’s team says that though this doesn’t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably dicult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it’s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer’s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it dicult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer’s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer’s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer’s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn’t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer’s team wouldn’t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn’t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer’s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn’t detect them, but the author doesn’t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer’s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples.",

    optionA: "A. Demanding",
    optionB: "B. Signaling",
    optionC: "C. Inviting",
    optionD: "D. Shifting",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “beckoning” most nearly means “inviting,” or attractive. The text portrays a woman who is looking at “trees in their spring beauty.” She compares them to cities, which have their own pleasures even if they do not have the “easy unhuman loveliness” of trees: she thinks of cities as “seductive” and “charming,” both adjectives that signify something that is enticing, or attractive. Therefore, cities that are seductive and charming would also be described as inviting people closer to them. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in this context that cities are “demanding,” or requiring effort. Choice B is incorrect. Though “signaling,” or communicating something, might be considered a key feature of the act of “beckoning,” in the context here, “beckoning” suggests that cities have attractive qualities that naturally draw people to them. Such attractive qualities are not described by the word “signaling” alone. Therefore, “signaling” is an incorrect answer because it is insuciently precise. Choice D is incorrect because there is no reason to think in this context that the cities are “shifting,” or changing shape.",

These mold-made sculptures present plants, animals, and human faces in precise ways—vessels representing human faces are so detailed that scholars have interpreted facial markings to represent scars and other skin irregularities. Some historians have even used these objects to identify potential skin diseases that may have aicted people at the time. Text 2 Art historian and archaeologist Lisa Trever has argued that the interpretation of Moche “portrait” vessels as hyper-realistic portrayals of identiable people may inadvertently disregard the creativity of the objects’ creators. Moche ceramic vessels, Trever argues, are artworks in which sculptors could free their imagination, using realistic objects and people around them as inspiration to explore more abstract concepts.

The rst sentence of the text indicates that Johnson returned to the US in 1938 at which time his painting style suddenly changed. The second sentence is underlined and gives more detail about this stylistic change, noting that his earlier work consisted largely of landscapes in an expressionist style and his new works were highly stylized portraits of Black Americans.

[...] His employer proving false to the contract in the matter of the land, and there being no law in the country to force him to full it, Israel—who, however brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch, seems nevertheless to have evinced, throughout many parts of his career, a singular patience and mildness—was obliged to look round for other means of livelihood than clearing out a farm for himself in the wilderness.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months’ work, but his employer then refused to fulll the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to nd another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer’s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was "brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch," he also possessed "a singular patience and mildness." In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of. Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm. Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel’s personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel’s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sucient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text—that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.',

    question:
      "In the early 1800s, the Cherokee scholar Sequoyah created the rst script, or writing system, for an Indigenous language in the United States. Because it represented the sounds of spoken Cherokee so accurately, his script was easy to learn and thus quickly achieved ______ use: by 1830, over 90 percent of the Cherokee people could read and write it. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. widespread",
    optionB: "B. careful",
    optionC: "C. unintended",
    optionD: "D. infrequent",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the writing system created by Sequoyah. In this context, “widespread” means widely accepted or practiced. The text indicates that because Sequoyah’s script accurately represented the spoken sounds of the Cherokee language and was easy to learn, nearly all Cherokee people were able to read and write it soon after it was created. This context demonstrates that the script was widely used by the Cherokee people. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, “careful” would mean exercised with care and attentive concern. Although the work of creating a writing system likely involved great care, the text indicates that the system was “easy to learn,” which conicts with the idea that using this system requires a noteworthy amount of care. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “unintended” means not deliberate. The idea that using Sequoyah’s script was unintentional conicts directly with the claim that it was easy to learn and used by “over 90% of the Cherokee people” by 1830. In fact, because one had to learn this system, it’s not clear how one could use it unintentionally. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “infrequent” means rare or not occurring often, which conicts directly with the claim that “over 90% of the Cherokee people” were using Sequoyah’s script by 1830.",

    question:
      "Text 1 Italian painters in the 1500s rarely depicted themselves in their work. Even more rare were self-portrait paintings that portrayed the artist as a painter. At the time, painting was not yet respected as a profession, so painters mostly chose to emphasize other qualities in their self-portraits, like their intellect or social status. In the city of Bologna, the rst artist to depict themself painting was a man named Annibale Carracci. A painting of his from around 1585 shows Carracci in front of an easel holding a palette. Text 2 In their self-portraits, Bolognese artists typically avoided referring to the act of painting until the mid-1600s. However, Lavinia Fontana’s 1577 painting, Self-Portrait at the Keyboard, stands out as the earliest example of such a work by an artist from Bologna. Although the artist is depicted playing music, in the background, one can spot a painting easel by a window. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. Carracci and Fontana were among the most well-respected painters in Bologna at the time.",
    optionB:
      "B. The depiction of Fontana in Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was intended to underscore the artist’s creativity.",
    optionC:
      "C. Fontana likely inspired the reference to an easel and palette in Carracci’s painting.",
    optionD:
      "D. Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was painted earlier than Carracci’s painting and also refers to the artist’s craft.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 states that Fontana’s painting, which depicts a painting easel in the background, was made in 1577, eight years before Carracci’s painting. Therefore, they might argue that Caracci was not “the rst artist” to depict themself as a painter. Choice A is incorrect. The texts don’t support this choice. Neither text mentions the reputation or status of either Carracci or Fontana. Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does not comment on the intention or meaning of Fontana’s self-depiction in Self-Portrait at the Keyboard. This choice also holds little connection to the underlined claim. Choice C is incorrect. The texts don’t support this choice. The author of Text 2 does not suggest any inspirational relationship between Fontana and Carracci. The author of Text 2 is concerned with showing that Fontana’s painting is the earliest example of an artist referring to painting in their selfportrait, but makes no mention of her inuence on others.",

To address this problem, a team of scientists used time-lapse cameras to record pollinator visits to red clover all day and night. The recordings showed that while most pollinator visits were by bumblebees, one-third of visits were by moths. Additionally, owers that were visited by both moths and bees produced more seeds than owers that were only visited by bees. Which choice best states the function of the underlined sentence?",
    optionA:
      "A. To describe an approach a team of scientists used to study pollinators",
    optionB: "B. To question a claim scientists make about pollinators",
    optionC: "C. To explain why moths prefer red clover to other owers",
    optionD: "D. To announce an unexpected research nding about red clover",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence. The sentence indicates that scientists used time-lapse photography during both day and night to detect pollinators visiting red clover. Therefore, the underlined sentence has the function of describing an approach scientists used in the pollinator study discussed in the text. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence discusses equipment the scientists used to conduct their study, and the text provides nothing to suggest these elements of their experimental design could, by themselves, question claims resulting from the study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in either the underlined sentence or the rest of the text addresses whether moths have a preference for red clover or any other owers. Choice D is incorrect. Although the sentences that follow the underlined sentence discuss research ndings, nothing in the text suggests that these ndings were unexpected. Moreover, the underlined sentence describes part of the scientists’ experimental design (day and night time-lapse photography), not a nding of the scientists’ study.",

    optionA: "A. validate",
    optionB: "B. interpret",
    optionC: "C. relate",
    optionD: "D. accommodate",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of letters allegedly exchanged between President Lincoln and Rutledge. In this context, “validate” means to conrm that something is real or correct. According to the text, it was alleged, or claimed, that the newly discovered letters had been written by Lincoln and Rutledge. The text also indicates that historians ultimately decided the letters were a hoax, or fraudulent. This context suggests that the historians couldn’t conrm that the letters were authentic. Choice B is incorrect. The text focuses on the authenticity of the letters, which were claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge and were then quickly dismissed as fraudulent by historians. Rather than conveying that the historians simply weren’t able to “interpret,” or explain in an understandable way, the letters’ authenticity, the text suggests that the historians decided the letters lacked authenticity altogether. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that the historians quickly dismissed the letters claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge as fraudulent; this suggests that rather than being unable to “relate,” or tell others about, the letters’ authenticity, the historians were able to share what they’d decided about the letters. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that the historians couldn’t “accommodate,” or give consideration to, the authenticity of the letters claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge; the text states that the historians decided that the letters were fraudulent, which indicates that they did consider whether the letters were authentic.",

      "Historians Tiya Miles and Roy E. Finkenbine have both documented the assistance Indigenous peoples gave to Black freedom seekers leaving the South before the US Civil War. Much of the historical evidence of this help comes from Indigenous oral traditions and from autobiographies written by the freedom seekers. One such narrative is Jermain Loguen’s autobiography, which tells about how Neshnabé (Potawatomi) villagers offered him food, lodging, and directions during his 1835 journey from Tennessee to Canada. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence?",
    optionA:
      "A. It provides an example of an autobiography that describes help given by an Indigenous people to a Black freedom seeker.",
    optionB:
      "B. It shows why Loguen decided to write in great detail about his experiences traveling from Tennessee to Canada in his autobiography.",
    optionC:

    optionD:
      "D. It suggests that most historians believe that Neshnabé villagers were more successful in assisting freedom seekers than other people were.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. The previous sentence broadly mentions "autobiographies written by the freedom seekers." This sentence identies Loguen’s autobiography as a specic example. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence never explains why Loguen chose to write about his experiences. Choice C is incorrect. The previous sentence identies autobiographies as useful sources of historical information about a specic topic, but not for "information about geography." The underlined sentence provides details of one autobiography as an example of a source of information about that specic topic (interactions between Indigenous people and Black freedom seekers). Choice D is incorrect. The text never discusses other specic people who helped freedom seekers, and therefore can’t make a comparison between the Neshnabé and anyone else.',

    optionB: "B. eclipses",
    optionC: "C. fabricates",
    optionD: "D. exemplies",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the collaboration between the Crow Tribe and Montana State University. As used in this context, “exemplies” means demonstrates. The text conveys how the Crow Tribe–Montana State University collaboration serves to illustrate the model of community-based participatory research introduced earlier in the text and expanded on later in the text. Choice A is incorrect because referring to “circumvents,” or avoids, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text suggests that the Crow Tribe–Montana State University collaboration serves as an example of the principles of community-based participatory research, not that the collaboration evades this model. Choice B is incorrect because referring to “eclipses,” or overshadows, wouldn’t make sense in context.

But chemist Takunda Chazovachii has helped develop a cleaner process of chemical recycling that converts superabsorbent polymers from diapers into a desirable reusable adhesive. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. resilient",
    optionB: "B. inadequate",
    optionC: "C. dynamic",
    optionD: "D. satisfactory",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about recycling plastics. In this context, “inadequate” means not satisfactory. The text indicates that the mechanical plastic-recycling process affects the environment and causes “the loss of material quality.” The text contrasts that with Chazovachii’s chemical plastic-recycling process, which is cleaner and produces a desirable product. The text’s emphasis on the negative aspects of mechanical recycling suggests that it is inadequate in terms of environmental impact and the quality of the material the process yields. Choice A is incorrect because in this context “resilient” would mean able to withstand diculty and the text does not characterize the plastic-recycling process as having this quality or describe any diculties that these processes might need to overcome. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “dynamic” would mean constantly changing. Although the text suggests that there have been changes in the eld of recycling, as is the case with the advent of Chazovachii’s chemical recycling process, there is nothing to suggest that the mechanical process itself has changed or is prone to change. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “satisfactory” would mean acceptable but not perfect. The text mentions only shortcomings of the mechanical process (environmental effects and lower material quality), so the text more strongly supports a negative view of this process and provides no evidence that it would be considered satisfactory.",

    optionA: "A. quantities",
    optionB: "B. decorations",
    optionC: "C. patterns",
    optionD: "D. agreements",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the ashes created by reies. In this context, “patterns” means distinct and predictable sequences. The text indicates that although the ashes that reies produce appear to occur randomly—that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm—each species actually produces its own special series of ashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of ashes are so unique that reies can use them to nd other members of their species. Therefore, this context supports the idea that reies produce ashes in distinct and recognizable patterns. Choice A is incorrect because “quantities” means certain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text discusses how different rey species produce ashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other members of their species to nd them, it doesn’t mention the number of ashes that are used in these sequences. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “decorations” would mean things that make an object more beautiful. Although it may be reasonable to say that rey ashes are beautiful, the text focuses on the fact that reies use these unique sequences of ashes to nd other members of their own species, not that the ashes make reies more beautiful. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “agreements” would refer to deals that individuals have discussed and come to a consensus about. Since reies aren’t capable of making such agreements, it wouldn’t make sense to use this word to refer to the signals they send each other with their ashes.",

      "Text 1 Astronomer Mark Holland and colleagues examined four white dwarfs—small, dense remnants of past stars—in order to determine the composition of exoplanets that used to orbit those stars. Studying wavelengths of light in the white dwarf atmospheres, the team reported that traces of elements such as lithium and sodium support the presence of exoplanets with continental crusts similar to Earth’s. Text 2 Past studies of white dwarf atmospheres have concluded that certain exoplanets had continental crusts. Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer Siyi Xu argue that those studies unduly emphasize atmospheric traces of lithium and other individual elements as signiers of the types of rock found on Earth. The studies don’t adequately account for different minerals made up of various ratios of those elements, and the possibility of rock types not found on Earth that contain those minerals. Based on the texts, how would Putirka and Xu (Text 2) most likely characterize the conclusion presented in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. As unexpected, because it was widely believed at the time that white dwarf exoplanets lack continental crusts",
    optionB:
      "B. As premature, because researchers have only just begun trying to determine what kinds of crusts white dwarf exoplanets had",
    optionC:
      "C. As questionable, because it rests on an incomplete consideration of potential sources of the elements detected in white dwarf atmospheres",
    optionD:
      "D. As puzzling, because it’s unusual to successfully detect lithium and sodium when analyzing wavelengths of light in white dwarf atmospheres",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it reects how Putirka and Xu (Text 2) would likely characterize the conclusion presented in Text 1. Text 1 discusses a study by Mark Holland and colleagues in which they detected traces of lithium and sodium in the atmospheres of four white dwarf stars. The team claims that this supports the idea that exoplanets with continental crusts like Earth’s once orbited these stars. Text 2 introduces Putirka and Xu, who indicate that sodium and lithium are present in several different minerals and that some of those minerals might exist in types of rock that are not found on Earth. Therefore, Putirka and Xu would likely describe the conclusion in Text 1 as questionable because it does not consider that lithium and sodium are also found in rocks that are not like Earth’s continental crust. Choice A is incorrect because the texts do not indicate how widely held any of the viewpoints described are. Choice B is incorrect because neither text discusses how new this area of study is.

    optionC: "C. conditions",
    optionD: "D. replenishes",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Indigenous method of harvesting Hierochloe odorata. As used in this context, “replenishes” means helps increase the population or helps it recover. The text explains that although snapping off a wild plant at the root might seem detrimental to the wild population, it actually helps Hierochloe odorata, increasing both their “number and vigor.” This context conveys the idea that even though it seems counterintuitive, the Indigenous method of harvesting Hierochloe odorata actually replenishes the wild population. Choice A is incorrect. Although a harvesting method could be used to select for certain traits in plants, it’s not clear what it would mean for a harvesting method to select “wild populations” of plants. Choice B is incorrect because as used in this context, “originates” means creates. The text doesn’t address the origin of Hierochloe odorata, but rather how the Indigenous harvesting method affects it.

Standing is more physically unstable and cognitively demanding than sitting; accordingly, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that standing subjects would display more risk aversion during the decision-making tasks than sitting subjects did, since they would want to avoid further feelings of discomfort and complicated risk evaluations. But O’Brien and Ahmed actually found no difference in the groups’ performance. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. It argues that research ndings about the effects of posture on cognition are often misunderstood, as in the case of O’Brien and Ahmed’s study.",
    optionB:
      "B. It presents the study by O’Brien and Ahmed to critique the methods and results reported in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition.",
    optionC:
      "C. It explains a signicant problem in the emerging understanding of posture’s effects on cognition and how O’Brien and Ahmed tried to solve that problem.",
    optionD:
      "D. It discusses the study by O’Brien and Ahmed to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about the effects of posture on cognition.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as a "case in point" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same—posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O’Brien and Ahmed’s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture’s effects on cognition. Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research ndings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture and cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O’Brien and Ahmed’s study is not one of those studies, and there is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O’Brien and Ahmed’s ndings. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture’s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O’Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem. O’Brien and Ahmed are presented as hypothesizing that posture would affect cognition in their study, not as trying to resolve the problem the text describes.',

I have just seen a most beautiful thing, Slim and still, Against a gold, gold sky, A straight black cypress, Sensitive, Exquisite, A black nger Pointing upwards. Why, beautiful still nger, are you black? And why are you pointing upwards? Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. The speaker assesses a natural phenomenon, then questions the accuracy of her assessment.",
    optionB:
      "B. The speaker describes a distinctive sight in nature, then ponders what meaning to attribute to that sight.",
    optionC:
      "C. The speaker presents an outdoor scene, then considers a human behavior occurring within that scene.",
    optionD:
      "D. The speaker examines her surroundings, then speculates about their inuence on her emotional state.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. First, the speaker describes observing a “most beautiful” sight: a tree (“black cypress”) standing out from the golden sky behind it, looking like a person’s nger “pointing upwards” and appearing “sensitive” and “exquisite.” Then the speaker wonders about the image’s meaning, asking why the nger is black and why it’s pointing upward. Thus, the text moves from the speaker’s description of a distinctive sight in nature to her pondering about what meaning to attribute to that sight. Choice A is incorrect because the speaker assesses a natural sight—a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed nger—but doesn’t question the accuracy of her own assessment. Although she wonders why the nger, which is really a tree, is black and why it’s pointing, the speaker doesn’t suggest that her belief that the tree resembles a nger is wrong. Choice C is incorrect. Although the speaker describes seeing a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed nger, she wonders about that natural image (asking why the nger, which is really a tree, is black and why it’s pointing) and doesn’t give any indication that any people are present in the scene. Choice D is incorrect. Although the speaker examines and wonders about one thing in her surroundings—a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed nger—she doesn’t address her own emotional state or consider how it’s affected by her surroundings.",

      "In studying the use of external stimuli to reduce the itching sensation caused by an allergic histamine response, Louise Ward and colleagues found that while harmless applications of vibration or warming can provide a temporary distraction, such ______ stimuli actually offer less relief than a stimulus that seems less benign, like a mild electric shock. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. deceptive",
    optionB: "B. innocuous",
    optionC: "C. novel",
    optionD: "D. impractical",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ward and colleagues’ ndings. As used in this context, “innocuous” means mild or unharmful. The text describes the vibration and warming that Ward and colleagues used to alleviate itching as “harmless applications” and goes on to contrast these applications with another stimulus that actually offers more relief even though it seems to be stronger and “less benign.” This context conveys the idea that vibration and warming were innocuous stimuli. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a distinction between harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign. Nothing in the text suggests that any of the treatments are “deceptive,” or misleading; indeed, even the less effective ones are described as offering some relief. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on the amount of relief from itching offered by harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign. The text doesn’t suggest that any of these stimuli are “novel,” or original and new; heat, vibration, and electricity aren’t new inventions. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to describe an application of vibration or warming as “impractical,” or not suitable for use. The text indicates that these harmless applications are useful in that they offer at least some temporary relief.",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. repeatable",
    optionB: "B. explicable",
    optionC: "C. regrettable",
    optionD: "D. intangible",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how Nia Imara facilitates the study of star formations. As used in this context "intangible" means unable to be physically handled or touched. The text states that star formations cannot be touched, and then goes on to explain that Imara created a special model to research star formations. In other words, despite the fact that real star formations are intangible, thanks to Imara, researchers can handle models of star formations to better understand them. Choice A is incorrect because "repeatable" means can be duplicated or done again, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that the swirls of gas and dust in which stars form are untouchable, but that Nia Imara has produced interactive models of them. It would therefore be illogical to suggest that Imara believes that the formations need not be duplicated and then go on to say that she has copied them. Choice B is incorrect because "explicable" means explainable or understandable, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Nia Imara believes that star formations can be fully explained but rather that she produced interactive models to physically study them because researchers are unable to touch them directly. Choice C is incorrect because "regrettable" means distressing or unfortunate, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Imara believes the researchers regret the star formations or nd them distressing, but rather that she uses interactive models to physically study them.',

      "In Jane Austen’s novel Manseld Park, an almost imperceptible smile from potential suitor Henry Crawford causes the protagonist Fanny Price to blush; her embarrassment grows when she suspects that he is aware of it. This moment—in which Fanny not only infers Henry’s mental state through his gestures, but also infers that he is drawing inferences about her mental state—illustrates what literary scholar George Butte calls “deep intersubjectivity,” a technique for representing interactions between consciousnesses through which Austen’s novels derive much of their social and psychological drama.

    optionD:
      "D. It provides a synopsis of an interaction in an Austen novel that illustrates a literary concept discussed in the following sentence.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The underlined sentence provides a concrete example to ground readers’ understanding of the “deep intersubjectivity” described in the next sentence as central to Austen’s work. Choice A is incorrect. There is no evaluation made of Austen’s skill in this sentence, and no examples are given in the following sentence. This choice essentially ips the paragraph: it’s this rst sentence that provides an example. Choice B is incorrect. There are no other Austen protagonists mentioned in this passage, so this couldn’t be the answer. Choice C is incorrect. The underlined sentence doesn’t identify any “recurring theme,” but instead simply describes one interaction from one book.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. impartial",
    optionB: "B. offhand",
    optionC: "C. persistent",
    optionD: "D. mandatory",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Annie Dodge Wauneka’s work as a Navajo Nation legislator. As used in this context, “persistent” means existing continuously. The text states that Wauneka “continuously worked to promote public health,” traveling extensively and authoring a medical dictionary; this indicates that Wauneka’s effort was persistent. Choice A is incorrect because describing Wauneka’s effort related to public health as “impartial,” or not partial or biased and treating all things equally, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text suggests that Wauneka’s continuous work was partial in one way, as she focused specically on promoting public health throughout the Navajo homeland and to speakers of the Navajo language. Choice B is incorrect because the text emphasizes that Wauneka’s effort to promote public health as a Navajo Nation legislator was continuous and extensive, involving wide travels and the authoring of a medical dictionary. Because this work clearly involved care and dedication, it wouldn’t make sense to describe it as “offhand,” or casual and informal. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Wauneka’s effort to promote public health was “mandatory,” or required by law or rule, even though Wauneka was a Navajo Nation legislator. Rather than suggesting that Wauneka’s effort was required for any reason, the text emphasizes the continuous and extensive nature of her work.",

    question:
      "Text 1 The idea that time moves in only one direction is instinctively understood, yet it puzzles physicists. According to the second law of thermodynamics, at a macroscopic level some processes of heat transfer are irreversible due to the production of entropy—after a transfer we cannot rewind time and place molecules back exactly where they were before, just as we cannot unbreak dropped eggs. But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes should be reversible. Text 2 In 2015, physicists Tiago Batalhão et al. performed an experiment in which they conrmed the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes at a quantum level, producing entropy by applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic eld to a system of carbon-13 atoms in liquid chloroform. But the experiment “does not pinpoint ... what causes [irreversibility] at the microscopic level,” coauthor Mauro Paternostro said. Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 1 most likely say about the experiment described in Text 2?",
    optionA:
      "A. It would suggest an interesting direction for future research were it not the case that two of the physicists who conducted the experiment disagree on the\nsignicance of its ndings.",
    optionB:
      "B. It provides empirical evidence that the current understanding of an aspect of physics at a microscopic level must be incomplete.",
    optionC:
      "C. It is consistent with the current understanding of physics at a microscopic level but not at a macroscopic level.",
    optionD:
      "D. It supports a claim about an isolated system of atoms in a laboratory, but that claim should not be extrapolated to a general claim about the universe.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. Author 1 describes the puzzle that physicists still can’t solve: at a microscopic level, the “laws of physics” suggest that we should be able to reverse processes that are not reversible at a macroscopic level (and, maybe, turn back time!). The experiment conrmed that those processes are not reversible even on the microscopic level, but it didn’t explain why. This supports Author 1’s point that physicists still don’t fully understand how things work at a microscopic level—maybe the laws need to be revised. Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Text 2 does name two of the physicists involved in the experiment, but it never suggests that they disagree on anything. Choice C is incorrect. This is the opposite of what the experiment suggests. The experiment conrmed that the macroscopic-level law (“these things can’t be reversed—like time”) was still true on the microscopic level—meaning it supports the current understanding of physics at a macroscopic level. Choice D is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Neither text makes this distinction between laboratory ndings and the way the universe works in general.",

    optionB: "B. ambivalence toward",
    optionC: "C. renunciation of",
    optionD: "D. mastery over",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s description of how Pico feels about the natural world. In this context, to say that Pico portrays his “ambivalence toward” nature would mean that he portrays his mixed feelings about nature. The text explains that Pico “honors the centrality of nature” and also makes it clear that he doesn’t enjoy being in nature. This context suggests that Pico feels ambivalence toward nature. Choice A is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “responsiveness to” nature would mean that he portrays himself as quick to react to nature, which isn’t supported by the text. Instead, the text focuses on Pico’s mixed feelings toward nature, describing him as both honoring nature’s role in his tribe’s beliefs and expressing his personal dislike for being in nature. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “renunciation of” nature would mean that he portrays himself as rejecting nature, which isn’t supported by the text. The text conveys that Pico demonstrates both positive and negative responses toward nature, not that he’s giving it up completely. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “mastery over” nature would mean that he portrays himself as having control over nature, which isn’t supported by the text.

      "Text 1 Graphic novels are increasingly popular in bookstores and libraries, but they shouldn’t be classied as literature. By denition, literature tells a story or conveys meaning through language only; graphic novels tell stories through illustrations and use language only sparingly, in captions and dialogue. Graphic novels are experienced as series of images and not as language, making them more similar to lm than to literature. Text 2 Graphic novels present their stories through both language and images. Without captions and dialogue, readers would be unable to understand what is depicted in the illustrations: the story results from the interaction of text and image. Moreover, Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home and many other graphic novels feature text that is as beautifully written as the prose found in many standard novels. Therefore, graphic novels qualify as literary texts. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the overall argument presented in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By asserting that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes",
    optionB:
      "B. By acknowledging that the author of Text 1 has identied a aw that is common to all graphic novels",
    optionC:
      "C. By suggesting that the story lines of certain graphic novels are more dicult to understand than the author of Text 1 claims",
    optionD:
      "D. By agreeing with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren’t as well crafted as most literary works are",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the argument presented in Text 1. In arguing that graphic novels shouldn’t be classied as literature and are more comparable to lm, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used "only sparingly"—that is, comparatively very little—in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn’t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are "beautifully written" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel’s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes. Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn’t be classied as literature based on their limited use of language, there’s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a aw, just that it doesn’t t the particular denition of "literature" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common aw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are "beautifully written," and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is awed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn’t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more dicult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn’t imply that graphic novels aren’t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to t the denition of "literature," and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to lm than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written—that is, well crafted—as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn’t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted.',

In this context, “inspecting” means viewing closely in order to examine. The text indicates that as particle physicists, Arce and El-Khadra’s work involves using advanced technology to “closely examine” subatomic particles. In other words, they use technology to inspect small parts of matter that can’t be seen by the naked eye.

The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that "every inch" of the taxi’s progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi’s attempt to drive down the street. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "disputing" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn’t portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "disputing" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn’t suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi’s attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi’s progress. Choice C is incorrect because, as the narrator explains, both the multitude of people and the taxi are using a public space (a street) at the same time. The narrator doesn’t go so far as to suggest that the people feel that they, and not the taxi, possess exclusive access to the street.',

    question:
      "Text 1 What factors inuence the abundance of species in a given ecological community? Some theorists have argued that historical diversity is a major driver of how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes: differences in community diversity across otherwise similar habitats, in this view, are strongly affected by the number of species living in those habitats at earlier times. Text 2 In 2010, a group of researchers including biologist Carla Cáceres created articial pools in a New York forest. They stocked some pools with a diverse mix of zooplankton species and others with a single zooplankton species and allowed the pool communities to develop naturally thereafter. Over the course of four years, Cáceres and colleagues periodically measured the species diversity of the pools, nding—contrary to their expectations—that by the end of the study there was little to no difference in the pools’ species diversity. Based on the texts, how would Cáceres and colleagues (Text 2) most likely describe the view of the theorists presented in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. It is largely correct, but it requires a minor renement in light of the research team’s results.",
    optionB:
      "B. It is not compelling as a theory regardless of any experimental data collected by the research team.",
    optionC:
      "C. It may seem plausible, but it is not supported by the research team’s ndings.",
    optionD:
      "D. It probably holds true only in conditions like those in the research team’s study.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer. This is how Cáceres and co. would most likely describe the view presented in Text 1. The view in Text 1 is that historical diversity affects how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes. But Cáceres and co. did not get this result: they found no difference in eventual diversity between a zooplankton pool that started out diverse and a zooplankton pool that started out with only a single species. Choice A is incorrect. Cáceres and co. would probably not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way. The view in Text 1 is that historical diversity affects how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes. Cáceres and co’s ndings directly undermine this view: they found no difference in eventual diversity between a zooplankton pool that started out diverse and a zooplankton pool that started out with only a single species. Choice B is incorrect. Cáceres and co. would probably not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way. Their experiment was designed to test this hypothesis, and their ndings were "contrary to their expectations." In other words, before the study, they predicted the theory was correct. Choice D is incorrect. Cáceres and co. would not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way. Their research nding directly undermines the view presented in Text 1: so it denitely doesn’t hold true in conditions like those in the study.',

    optionB: "B. carelessly",
    optionC: "C. rarely",
    optionD: "D. simply",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the discovery of a carved wooden gure dating to around 2,000 years ago. In this context, “rarely” means infrequently. The text states that the discovery of the gure was “truly surprising” and notes that wooden objects are highly prone to rot. This context conveys the idea that wooden objects infrequently survive for as long as the carved gure has survived. Choice A is incorrect because “sturdily” means strongly, which wouldn’t make sense in context. If wooden objects in general could strongly survive for long periods of time, then the discovery of a wooden gure that’s around 2,000 years old wouldn’t be surprising. Choice B is incorrect because “carelessly” means accidentally. The text conveys the idea that wooden objects in general don’t survive for very long because they rot, not that wooden objects in general accidentally survive despite this. Choice D is incorrect because the text conveys the idea that wooden objects in general don’t survive for very long because they rot, not that wooden objects in general “simply,” or merely, survive for long periods of time. If wooden objects in general could merely survive for as long as the gure has survived, then the discovery of the gure wouldn’t have been surprising.",

    question:
      "Text 1 Mycoprotein is a fungal biomass that can be eaten as an alternative to meat. Studies of the environmental impact of its manufacture generally agree it is lower than that of beef and closer to that of chicken or pork. But the expense of producing mycoprotein restricts its availability to a few countries with postindustrial economies. Knowing that cost reductions would expand access to mycoprotein, biochemists are exploring solutions, such as a cheaper substrate to feed the mycoprotein as it grows. Text 2 Cattle farming is a principal cause of global deforestation, and a study by Florian Humpenöder and his colleagues found that replacing 20% of beef consumption worldwide with consumption of mycoprotein would cut deforestation by half if accomplished over the next thirty years. However, this would likely involve only a small change in agricultural water consumption, since water once dedicated to raising cattle would be diverted to raising crops instead. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the study ndings mentioned in Text 2?",
    optionA:
      "A. By emphasizing that since agricultural water consumption would remain static in the event of replacing beef consumption with mycoprotein consumption, an\neffort must be made to substitute mycoprotein for chicken and pork in diets as well",
    optionB:
      "B. By asserting that the development of a more inexpensive substrate for mycoprotein production would contribute to the goal of decreasing worldwide\ndeforestation over time",
    optionC:
      "C. By noting that most people would be more likely to use mycoprotein as a substitute for chicken or pork in their diets than as a substitute for beef",
    optionD:
      "D. By pointing out that some countries are responsible for greater deforestation than others and thus, to have any signicant effect on the environment, will have\nto replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to the study ndings described in Text 2. The author of Text 2 discusses a study by Florian Humpenöder and his colleagues that found that deforestation would be reduced by half over the next thirty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide were replaced with mycoprotein. The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study ndings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people’s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people’s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally benecial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specic issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue. Choice C is incorrect. Although Text 1 does compare the environmental effects of producing mycoprotein to those of producing chicken or pork, nothing in Text 1 suggests that the author believes that people are more likely to replace chicken or pork with mycoprotein than they are to replace beef with mycoprotein. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 makes no mention of countries’ varying contributions to deforestation, so there is no evidence that the author of Text 1 would respond to the nding described in Text 2 by saying that some countries will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein.",

    optionA: "A. delegate",
    optionB: "B. compose",
    optionC: "C. interpret",
    optionD: "D. renounce",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of John Ashbery’s poems. As used in this context, “interpret” would mean decipher the meaning of. The text indicates that Ashbery’s poems have many unusual features, that it’s dicult to tell what exactly the poems’ subject matter is, and that scholars strongly disagree about the poems. This context conveys the idea that it’s dicult to interpret Ashbery’s poems. Choice A is incorrect because “delegate” means to assign someone as a representative of another person or to entrust something to someone else, neither of which would make sense in context. The text is focused only on the diculty that readers have interpreting Ashbery’s poems due to their many unusual features; it doesn’t suggest anything about the poems being dicult to delegate. Choice B is incorrect because describing Ashbery’s poems as dicult to “compose,” or put together or produce, would make sense only if the text were about Ashbery’s experience of writing the poems. It could be true that it was dicult for Ashbery to compose his poems, but the text doesn’t address this; it instead discusses how readers interpret and engage with the poems. Choice D is incorrect because describing Ashbery’s poems as being dicult to “renounce,” or give up or refuse, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that features of Ashbery’s poems are odd or unclear and have caused heated scholarly debate. This context suggests that the poems are dicult to interpret, not that the poems are dicult to renounce.",

    optionC: "C. protect",
    optionD: "D. decorate",

    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer. "Protect" means "preserve" or "keep safe from." By ensuring that the wilderness areas along the Appalachian Trail can’t be sold or developed, the National Trails System Act protects them. Choice A is incorrect. "Borrow" means "to take something with intent to return it." The text doesn’t say anything about taking and returning the wilderness that surrounds the Appalachian Trail. Choice B is incorrect. "Postpone" means "to put off until later." Nothing in the passage suggests that Congress wants to "postpone" the wilderness areas (and that doesn’t make sense anyway—they can postpone doing something to the wilderness areas, but they can’t postpone the areas themselves).

Lily had no real intimacy with nature, but she had a passion for the appropriate and could be keenly sensitive to a scene which was the tting background of her own sensations. The landscape outspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and she found something of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its long free reaches. On the nearer slopes the sugar-maples wavered like pyres of light; lower down was a massing of grey orchards, and here and there the lingering green of an oak-grove.

    optionC: "C. It makes an assertion that the next sentence then expands on.",
    optionD:
      "D. It illustrates an idea that is introduced in the previous sentence.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence of the text establishes that Lily can be “keenly sensitive to” scenes that serve as a “tting background” for her feelings—that is, she’s very aware of when a setting seems to reect her mood. The next sentence, which is underlined, then demonstrates this awareness: Lily views the landscape she’s in as a large-scale reection of her current mood, identifying with elements such as its calmness. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to illustrate an idea introduced in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes the scene only in very general terms, referring to its calmness, breadth, and long stretches of land. It’s the next sentence that adds specic details about colors, light, and various trees nearby. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence suggests that Lily is experiencing an internal conict. In fact, the sentence indicates that Lily thinks the landscape reects her own feeling of calmness. Choice C is incorrect because the only assertion in the underlined sentence is that Lily feels that broad aspects of the landscape, such as its calmness, reect her current mood, and that assertion isn’t expanded on in the next sentence. Instead, the next sentence describes specic details of the scene without connecting them to Lily’s feelings.",

    question:
      "Text 1 Flamingos are known for their vibrant pink coloring, but they’re actually born with gray feathers. Their pink color comes from eating brine shrimp, but brine shrimp aren’t naturally pink either. Animals can’t produce carotenoids, the pigments that provide the pink hue. The algae that brine shrimp feed on, however, can produce these pigments. Thus, the pinker the amingo, the more shrimp it has eaten. Text 2 Ecologist Juan Amat has found that amingos apply a kind of makeup to make themselves appear pinker. A gland near their tail contains pigments that come from the food they eat. When the amingos groom themselves using the pigments, their feathers become pinker. Flamingos may do this to improve their success during mating season, when they would benet from looking pinker. Based on the texts, how would the ecologist in Text 2 most likely respond to the author’s conclusion in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By emphasizing that amingos’ tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers are",
    optionB:
      "B. By claiming that the coloring of amingos’ feathers doesn’t change signicantly enough for most observers to notice",
    optionC:
      "C. By pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn’t the only thing that inuences amingos’ coloring",
    optionD:
      "D. By arguing that amingos’ diet doesn’t include much shrimp except during mating season",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it describes how the ecologist in Text 2 would most likely respond to the author’s conclusion in Text 1 based on the information provided. The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of amingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp amingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a amingo that is pinker than another amingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that amingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a amingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the amingo’s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker amingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn’t the only thing that inuences amingos’ coloring. Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that amingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn’t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a amingo’s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that amingos’ feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn’t notice a change wouldn’t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a amingo’s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about amingos’ shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that amingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn’t discuss the diet of amingos at all.",

Female cuckoos have been seen quickly laying eggs in the nests of other bird species when those birds are out looking for food. After the eggs hatch, the noncuckoo parents will typically raise the cuckoo chicks as if they were their own offspring, even if the cuckoos look very different from the other chicks. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?",

      "C. It offers a detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior discussed in the text.",
    optionD:
      "D. It explains how other birds react to the female cuckoo behavior discussed in the text.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst two sentences establish that birds of some species don’t raise their own young; instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of birds of other species. The underlined sentence then states that female cuckoo birds engage in this behavior, having been observed specically laying their eggs in other nests while the other birds are out nding food. According to the text, the cuckoo chicks are then raised by the other birds. Thus, the underlined sentence provides a particular detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior of laying eggs for other birds to raise. Choice A is incorrect. Rather than mentioning a physical feature of female cuckoos, the underlined sentence introduces a specic behavior of female cuckoos: laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away. The only reference to physical features is the last sentence’s general mention of cuckoo chicks looking different from chicks of other species. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and doesn’t describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise. Instead, the sentence addresses how female cuckoos use other birds’ nests. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes only female cuckoo behavior (laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away); it’s the last sentence of the text that addresses the other birds’ reaction, indicating that those birds usually raise the cuckoo chicks once they’ve hatched.",

      "D. It explains a hypothesis that has been the subject of scientic debate, discusses how a research team tested that hypothesis, and then presents data the team\ncollected that validate the hypothesis.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by explaining that human activities inuence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues’ hypothesis regarding this question—which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer—and then briey explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a nding that conicts with the team’s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientic question, presents a research team’s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conicted with their hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities inuence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn’t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team’s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn’t describe how the team rened their hypothesis when a research nding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientic question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question.

Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientic debate; rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by Okolo and colleagues.

    optionB: "B. precursors of",
    optionC: "C. commonalities with",
    optionD: "D. animosities toward",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of architectural inuences among Mesoamerican cities. In this context, “commonalities with” means similarities to or shared attributes with. The text indicates that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in Teotihuacán (another Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuacán inuence, which suggests that the citadel possesses features that resemble architectural features found in Teotihuacán. This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuacán architecture. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows “renements of,” or improvements on, Teotihuacán architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuacán inuenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it’s possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn’t discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuacán architecture, the Tikal citadel’s builders improved on it. Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing “precursors of” Teotihuacán architecture—or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuacán architecture—would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuacán. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuacán, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuacán, provides evidence of outside inuences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was inuenced by Teotihuacán architecture, then the Teotihuacán architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn’t make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuacán architecture. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the inuence of Teotihuacán architecture, which implies that the makers of the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuacán architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there’s no reason to think that the Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people’s “animosities toward,” or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward, Teotihuacán architecture.",

      'Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "sheltering" most nearly means protective. In the text, the speaker describes a painting featuring a female gure. The speaker ultimately confesses to falling in love with the woman in the painting, who has "stole[n] away" the speaker’s heart, but rst the speaker describes elements of the painting’s setting. These include sterile soil, barren elds with "no ray / Of hope in a blade of green"—a description that conveys a mood of melancholy and forlornness, possibly reecting the speaker’s own sadness at falling in love with an image that can’t return the speaker’s love. The text continues by stating that there’s no "sheltering roof" in the painting, even though the "skies are heavy and gray," showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof’s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive—that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldn’t limit the wind and rain, only deect them. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that if a "sheltering roof" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word "sheltering" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that if any roofs were present in the painting, they would be questionable or cause any suspicion.',

    question:
      "The following text is adapted from Sui Sin Far’s 1912 short story “Mrs. Spring Fragrance.” Mr. and Mrs. Spring Fragrance immigrated to the United States from China. Mrs. Spring Fragrance was unaware that Mr. Spring Fragrance, tired with the day’s business, had thrown himself down on the bamboo settee on the veranda, and that although his eyes were engaged in scanning the pages of the Chinese World, his ears could not help receiving the words which were borne to him through the open window. As used in the text, what does the word “receiving” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Denying",
    optionB: "B. Entering",
    optionC: "C. Carrying",
    optionD: "D. Hearing",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “receiving” most nearly means hearing, or perceiving sound. The text describes Mr. Spring Fragrance as he reads a newspaper, focusing on his eyes and ears. While his eyes look at the newspaper, he is unwillingly distracted by words coming through a nearby open window (that is, “his ears could not help receiving the words”). The words are being perceived specically by his ears and not his eyes, and ears are the organs of sense with which one hears, so therefore Mr. Spring Fragrance is hearing the words through the open window. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that Mr. Spring Fragrance is denying, or refusing the truth of, the words coming to him through the window. He is merely distracted by them. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that Mr. Spring Fragrance’s ears couldn’t help entering, or coming into, the words coming to him through the window. Instead, the text indicates that the opposite occurs: that is, when Mr. Spring Fragrance hears the words, they enter his ears, but his ears don’t enter the words. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn’t make sense in this context to think of Mr. Spring Fragrance as carrying the words coming to him through the window, even though the word “carry” can have a number of different meanings depending on context: for example, he is not lifting them, he is not supporting them, and he is not accepting blame for them (as one “carries the blame” for a mistake).",

    question:
      "While we can infer information about climate activity in Earth’s distant past from physical evidence, we of course cannot observe past climates directly. To study early Earth’s climate in action, we must ______ that climate using computer models that represent various climate conditions consistent with the physical evidence. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. invent",
    optionB: "B. simulate",
    optionC: "C. exaggerate",
    optionD: "D. preserve",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of climate activity in Earth’s distant past. In this context, to “simulate” most nearly means to represent a natural process using computer models. According to the text, understanding Earth’s early climate is dicult because we cannot make direct observations of the distant past. Instead, scientists must create computer models that approximate early climate conditions, based on the physical evidence that those conditions left behind on Earth’s surface. This context supports the idea that computer models simulate Earth’s climate in the distant past. Choice A is incorrect because scientists use existing physical evidence as a basis for developing computer models that describe what Earth’s actual past climate might have been like. The models are not being used to “invent,” or imagine, a completely ctional climate. Choice C is incorrect because the computer models are being used in an attempt to describe as accurately as possible what Earth’s past climate might have been like. They are not attempting to “exaggerate,” or distort, those features. Choice D is incorrect because the computer models do not “preserve,” or protect from deterioration, Earth’s early climate; instead, they attempt to reproduce the characteristics of that climate, based on the remaining physical evidence of that climate.",

    question:
      "Historians have argued that a crucial component of the Civil Rights Movement’s success in the 1960s was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s Citizen Education Program (CEP), which invited promising activists from across the South to its one-week training sessions in Dorchester, Georgia. Led by experienced organizers such as Dorothy Cotton and Septima Clark, CEP attendees—more than 7,000 in all—participated in workshops on topics ranging from public speaking to legal doctrine before returning home and using their newly acquired knowledge to spearhead local civil rights initiatives. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",
    optionA:
      "A. It underscores the extent of the CEP’s impact on the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.",
    optionB:
      "B. It illustrates the CEP organizers’ efforts to educate participants on a wide variety of topics.",
    optionC:
      "C. It suggests that CEP attendees held a diverse array of opinions about the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s political philosophy.",
    optionD:
      "D. It establishes that criticism of the CEP was limited to a few individuals in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence of the text states that the CEP had a positive impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. The next sentence explains that the CEP organized workshops for attendees, who later used the knowledge they gained to lead civil rights initiatives. And the underlined portion indicates the number of activists—more than 7,000—who participated in the workshops. Thus, the underlined portion provides a number that underscores the extent of the CEP’s impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Choice B is incorrect. Although the sentence that contains the underlined portion mentions some CEP workshop topics, the underlined portion itself addresses the number of participants in the CEP workshops, not the number of topics covered. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion refers to attendees of the CEP workshops, nothing in the underlined portion or the text as a whole addresses the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s philosophy or the attendees’ opinions thereof. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole mentions any criticism of the CEP by members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.",

This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. As used in the text, what does the word “quality” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Standard",
    optionB: "B. Prestige",
    optionC: "C. Characteristic",
    optionD: "D. Accomplishment",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. “This quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context. Here, “this quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his. “Standard” is a synonym for a different denition of “quality”: the degree of excellence of something. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context. Here, “this quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his. “Prestige” would suggest a high status or an admirable reputation, which doesn’t match that description. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context.

      "Text 1 In a study of the benets of having free time, Marissa Sharif found that the reported sense of life satisfaction tended to plateau when participants had two hours of free time per day and actually began to fall when they had ve hours of free time per day. After further research, Sharif concluded that this dip in life satisfaction mainly occurred when individuals spent all their free time unproductively, such as by watching TV or playing games. Text 2 Psychologist James Maddux cautions against suggesting an ideal amount of free time. The human desire for both free time and productivity is universal, but Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction. Furthermore, he points out that there is no objective denition for what constitutes productivity; reading a book might be considered a productive activity by some, but idleness by others. Based on the texts, how would Maddux (Text 2) most likely respond to the conclusion Sharif (Text 1) reached after her further research?",
    optionA:
      "A. By acknowledging that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively than when it is spent unproductively",
    optionB:
      "B. By challenging the reasoning in Text 1, as it has not been proved that productivity commonly contributes to individuals’ life satisfaction",
    optionC:
      "C. By warning against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities",
    optionD:
      "D. By claiming that the specic activities named in Text 1 are actually examples of productive activities rather than unproductive ones",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it characterizes how Maddux would most likely respond to the conclusion Sharif reached after her research. Text 1 describes Sharif’s study of the benets of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at ve hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she denes as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective denition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. Choice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after ve hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively—that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively. Choice D is incorrect because Maddux holds the opinion that whether an activity is productive or unproductive is subjective and depends on the individual; therefore, he would most likely claim that watching TV or playing games might be productive for some and unproductive for others.",

The company further solidied its ______ in rail access to the state’s Pacic coast when it completed the Sunset Route in 1883: running from Louisiana to Southern California, the route established the rst transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. dominance",
    optionB: "B. creativity",
    optionC: "C. insignicance",
    optionD: "D. neutrality",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of the Southern Pacic Railroad. As used in this context, "dominance" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacic Railroad already controlled 85% of California’s railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the rst transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacic Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California’s coast. Choice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word "creativity" would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Pacic Railroad already controlled 85% of California’s railways. The text is more focused on the railroad’s control of the eld and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Pacic Railroad controlled the majority of California’s railways, it would not make sense to refer to its "insignicance," or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Pacic Railroad’s "neutrality," or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned. Nor would "neutrality" in the sense of impartiality in a conict be a logical or precise choice since no conict is explicitly described. There might be an implied conict between the Southern Pacic Railroad and other railroads doing business in California, but that is not a conict in which the Southern Pacic Railroad would take an impartial position.',

      "Mathematician Claude Shannon is widely regarded as a foundational gure in information theory. His most important paper, “A Mathematical Theory of Communication,” published in 1948 when he was employed at Bell Labs, utilized a concept called a “binary digit” (shortened to “bit”) to measure the amount of information in any signal and determine the fastest rate at which information could be transmitted while still being reliably decipherable. Robert Gallagher, one of Shannon’s colleagues, said that the bit was “[Shannon’s] discovery, and from it the whole communications revolution has sprung.” Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",
    optionA:

      "Text 1 Today the starchy root cassava is found in many dishes across West Africa, but its rise to popularity was slow. Portuguese traders brought cassava from Brazil to the West African coast in the 1500s. But at this time, people living in the capitals further inland had little contact with coastal communities. Thus, cassava remained relatively unknown to most of the region’s inhabitants until the 1800s. Text 2 Cassava’s slow adoption into the diet of West Africans is mainly due to the nature of the crop itself. If not cooked properly, cassava can be toxic. Knowledge of how to properly prepare cassava needed to spread before the food could grow in popularity. The arrival of formerly enslaved people from Brazil in the 1800s, who brought their knowledge of cassava and its preparation with them, thus directly fueled the spread of this crop. Based on the texts, the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?",
    optionA:
      "A. Cassava did not become a signicant crop in West Africa until long after it was rst introduce",
    optionB:
      "B. Several of the most commonly grown crops in West Africa are originally from Brazil.",
    optionC:

    optionD:
      "D. The most commonly used methods to cook cassava today date to the 1500s.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. Text 1 states that cassava’s “rise to popularity was slow” in West Africa. Text 2 also describes cassava’s “slow adoption into the diet of West Africans.” While the two texts identify different causes for this slow adoption, both agree that cassava took a long time to catch on. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t something that either text claims. Cassava is the only crop discussed in the passages, so we have no basis to draw conclusions about what the authors might say about “several” crops. Choice C is incorrect.

    optionD:
      "D. To describe certain limitations to conducting scientic study in the Atacama Desert",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence describes a unique location on Earth, the Atacama Desert. The next sentence, which is the underlined sentence, states that the reason why astrobiologists study life, or its remains, in this unique location is that Atacama is a harsh environment that closely resembles the extreme environment of Mars. The remainder of the text explains that the researchers hope their work in Atacama will support inquiry into life on Mars. Thus, the underlined portion functions mainly to indicate why astrobiologists choose to conduct research in the Atacama Desert. Choice A is incorrect because to contrast two things means to show the differences between them, and the phrase "closely mirrors" in the underlined sentence indicates that the extreme environment in the Atacama Desert is similar to, not different from, that on Mars. This similarity is why, according to the underlined sentence, astrobiologists conduct research in Atacama. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t address forms of life that are unable to survive the harsh environment of the Atacama Desert. Instead, the underlined sentence explains why astrobiologists study life, or its remains, in this environment. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t suggest that the scientic research in the Atacama Desert is limited in any way; instead, the sentence explains that the similarity between the environments of Atacama and Mars is the reason why astrobiologists search for life, or its remains, in Atacama.',

    optionD: "D. Select",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text "determine" most nearly means "dictate." The text describes the relationship between the main character and those who exhibit, praise, and purchase his artwork. The text states that the main character is often asked to change his art or himself based on outside inuences, and he usually acquiesces. Because the main character admits that those who support his work often shape it based on their demands, it follows that those outside inuences dictate, or guide or dominate, the direction his work takes. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that outside inuences "conclude," or end, the main character’s work. The text states that many supporters of the main character’s art "demand its proliferation," not its conclusion. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that outside inuences are "evaluating," or judging the main character’s work. According to the text, the main character’s art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, and praising his work.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the research that Lopes-Ferreira and her colleagues are conducting on the stingray species Potamotrygon rex. As used in this context, “a substantial” effect means an effect that is sizable or noteworthy. The text indicates that the researchers are seeking to determine whether there are “considerable variations” in the potency of stingray venom that are associated with variation in the stingrays’ age and sex. This context suggests that the researchers want to nd out whether stingray age and sex have a substantial effect on venom toxicity. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the researchers have been studying whether the stingrays’ age and sex have “a disconcerting,” or an unsettling and disturbing, effect on the stingrays’ venom. The text indicates that the researchers wish to determine if stingray age and sex cause large variations in the toxicity of stingray venom, not if the effect of age and sex is disconcerting. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that researchers want to nd out whether differences in stingray age and sex produce differences in stingray venom, not that the researchers want to nd out whether age and sex have “an acceptable,” or a satisfactory, effect on venom. The text makes no mention of what would make an effect on venom toxicity acceptable and gives no indication that the researchers are interested in that question. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for the researchers to be looking for “an imperceptible,” or an unnoticeable, effect of age and sex on stingray venom.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the preservation efforts undertaken by Erika Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana. In this context, "promote" means play a part in the success or growth of something or someone. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes work to preserve culturally important sites. It goes on to say that their decision to create a national trail connecting the sites was motivated by the fact that such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn’t otherwise receive. Thus, such a decision would promote the preservation efforts. Choice A is incorrect because "inspire" means motivate or inuence, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text establishes that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally signicant sites and that their decision to create a new national trail occurred as a result of a desire to add protections to the sites that they wouldn’t otherwise receive. Thus, creating the trail wouldn’t inspire the efforts to preserve the sites; instead, it would promote the efforts.

The team found that the greater the exposure to sunshine at work in the two weeks before a manager submitted an earnings forecast, the more the manager’s forecast exceeded what the company actually earned that year. Which choice best states the function of the underlined sentence in the overall structure of the text?",
    optionA: "A. To summarize the results of the team’s analysis",
    optionB:
      "B. To present a specic example that illustrates the study’s ndings",
    optionC: "C. To explain part of the methodology used in the team’s study",
    optionD:
      "D. To call out a challenge the team faced in conducting its analysis",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence presents the implications of Veeraraghavan’s team’s study: sunshine exposure during work hours can cause overly optimistic behavior. The underlined sentence then describes the data the team consulted and how they were used (comparing predictions about earnings to what the companies actually earned), and the nal sentence presents what the team found in their examination of the data. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to explain part of the methodology used in the team’s study. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence explains in part how the team conducted their analysis of the effect of sunshine but doesn’t address what the team found; a broad summary is instead given in the other two sentences. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t present any specic examples from the team’s comparisons of 29,000 earnings predictions to actual earnings; it simply explains in part how the team conducted their analysis. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence simply explains in part how the team conducted their analysis; the text never mentions any challenges that the team encountered in their study.",

      "Text 1 Fossils of the hominin Australopithecus africanus have been found in the Sterkfontein Caves of South Africa, but assigning an age to the fossils is challenging because of the unreliability of dating methods in this context. The geology of Sterkfontein has caused soil layers from different periods to mix, impeding stratigraphic dating, and dates cannot be reliably imputed from those of nearby animal bones since the bones may have been relocated by ooding. Text 2 Archaeologists used new cosmogenic nuclide dating techniques to reevaluate the ages of",
    optionA:
      "A. africanus fossils found in the Sterkfontein Caves may have been corrupted in some way over the years.",
    optionB:

    optionD:
      "D. They would claim that cosmogenic nuclide dating is reliable in the context of the Sterkfontein Caves because it is applied to the fossils directly.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer. Text 2 states that the researchers used cosmogenic nuclide dating to "avoid the potential for misdating" caused by the geology of Sterkfontein, which Text 1 describes as "challenging" and unreliable. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text suggests that the A. africanus fossils have been "corrupted," but only that traditional dating methods are dicult in Sterkfontein because of oods and soil mixing where the fossils were found. Nothing is implied to have compromised the fossils themselves. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 2. Text 2 agrees that stratigraphy and other methods are prone to error in the context of Sterkfontein: there’s a "potential for misdating" when evaluating age based on soil layers and bones. Choice D is incorrect. Text 2 does not state that cosmogenic nuclide dating is applied to the fossils directly but rather to the breccia that surrounds them.',

When these animals died out, cucurbits faced extinction in turn, having lost their means of seed dispersal. Around this time, however, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America began raising cucurbits as crops, thus ______ the plants’ survival.

    optionA: "A. verifying",
    optionB: "B. multiplying",
    optionC: "C. comforting",
    optionD: "D. ensuring",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of cucurbits. In this context, “ensuring” means guaranteeing, or making sure of, the cucurbits’ survival. The text states that cucurbits faced extinction in the past because their means of seed dispersal disappeared, but the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America began farming cucurbits around that same time, so the crops were no longer threatened. Therefore, the context supports the idea that the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America helped with ensuring the cucurbits’ survival. Choice A is incorrect because in this context verifying means making sure that something is accurate. In the text, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America were ensuring the survival, not the accuracy of, the cucurbits. Choice B is incorrect. Although the cucurbit crops themselves were multiplying, or growing in number, as a result of the work of the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America, it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that the survival of the plants was multiplying.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. a collaboration",
    optionB: "B. an accessory",
    optionC: "C. a contradiction",
    optionD: "D. an analogy",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. The text after the semicolon tells us that Hu "identif[ied] broad similarities between two seemingly different phenomena," comparing ants with light particles. Since an analogy seeks similarities between seemingly unrelated phenomena, this ts the context perfectly. Choice A is incorrect. "A collaboration" refers to "an act of working with others," but what comes after the semicolon doesn’t describe collaboration with other researchers. Instead, it shows a comparison between two different (but ultimately similar) scientic phenomena. Choice B is incorrect. "An accessory" can refer to "something added to increase attractiveness or usefulness." No accessories are described in this text. Choice C is incorrect. "A contradiction" means "a set of ideas or things that are opposed to or inconsistent with each other." The text describes how Hu used the similarity between ant and light particle movement to develop his method, so a word that refers to difference would not make sense here.',

    question:
      "The way in which individual elements are balanced within a photographic image tends to affect how viewers perceive it: symmetry tends to give the elements equal importance, asymmetry emphasizes differences, and radial balance (organizing the elements around a central point) emphasizes the center over the periphery. What a photograph conveys is therefore largely ______ how it is balanced. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. inhibited by",
    optionB: "B. contingent on",
    optionC: "C. obligated to",
    optionD: "D. reserved for",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of visual balance in photography. In this context, "contingent on" means conditional upon, or determined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends to emphasize similarity among elements, whereas asymmetry tends to emphasize difference). Thus, there is a strong connection between what a photograph conveys and how its elements are balanced. Therefore, what a photo conveys is contingent on how it is balanced. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "inhibited by" most nearly means hindered or undermined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers, thereby indicating a relationship between image balance and what is conveyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a photographer choosing asymmetrical balance even while intending to convey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), there is nothing to indicate that messages generally are inhibited by balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a tool photographers can use to craft their messages. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "obligated to" means duty bound toward or answerable to. In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph’s message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, "reserved for" most nearly means solely available to someone or held aside for some purpose. The text as a whole does not support the claim that a photograph’s message is reserved for how that photograph is balanced.',

      "The following text is adapted from Zora Neale Hurston’s 1921 short story “John Redding Goes to Sea.” John is a child who lives in a town in the woods. Perhaps ten-year-old John was puzzling to the folk there in the Florida woods for he was an imaginative child and fond of day-dreams. The St. John River owed a scarce three hundred feet from his back door. On its banks at this point grow numerous palms, luxuriant magnolias and bay trees. On the bosom of the stream oat millions of delicately colored hyacinths. [John Redding] loved to wander down to the water’s edge, and, casting in dry twigs, watch them sail away down stream to Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world and [he] wanted to follow them.

      "D. It suggests that John longs to experience a larger life outside the Florida woods.",
    correctAnswer: 3,

The text establishes that John has a strong imagination and then goes on to describe the St. John River near John’s home in the Florida woods. The underlined sentence depicts John sending twigs sailing down the river while he imagines them reaching “Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world,” where he wishes he could follow. This suggests that John longs to expand his life experiences beyond the Florida woods. Choice A is incorrect because the second and third sentences of the text provide an extended description of the riverbank where John likes to go, whereas the underlined sentence describes what John does at that location. Choice B is incorrect because the rst sentence of the text suggests that John’s behavior “was puzzling” to others around him, whereas the underlined sentence concerns the content of John’s imaginings.

[Coketown] contained several large streets all very like one another, and many small streets still more like one another, inhabited by people equally like one another, who all went in and out at the same hours, with the same sound upon the same pavements, to do the same work, and to whom every day was the same as yesterday and tomorrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next.

This repetition of similarities emphasizes how everything in Coketown is alike. Choice B is incorrect. While the text mentions that all the residents “do the same work,” it never explains what that work is or why everyone does it. Besides, the idea that they all do the same work is just one of several similarities among the townspeople described in the text. Choice C is incorrect. While the last sentence states that “every day was the same as yesterday and tomorrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next,” it never suggests that people actually “lose track of time.” This is also too narrow to be the main idea, since time is just one of many aspects of Coketown that the text describes as always being the same. Choice D is incorrect. The text never mentions whether life is simple in Coketown, and the town sounds as though it’s probably a pretty dull place to live, rather than a pleasant one.",

    optionB: "B. antagonistic toward",
    optionC: "C. imitated by",
    optionD: "D. inconsequential to",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the twelfth-century Islamic philosopher Ibn Rushd. As used in this context, "inconsequential to" means not signicant to. According to the text, Ibn Rushd’s works were primarily available in Spain, where he lived, far from central areas of the Muslim world, a fact that could support the conclusion that his inuence on Muslim contemporaries was limited. The text implies, however, that recent scholarship has shown that his works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time. This context supports the idea that his works weren’t inconsequential to Islamic thought in this period. Choice A is incorrect because the issue under consideration in the text is whether other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd’s time had access to his works, not whether his works were "controversial among," or causing dispute among, other philosophers. Choice B is incorrect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd’s era were aware of his works, not that they were "antagonistic toward," or hostile toward, them. There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd’s writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "imitated by" would mean followed as a model by. Although the text implies that Ibn Rushd’s works were at least somewhat available in regions that were at the center of Islamic thought during the period, it doesn’t specically address in what ways his works inuenced contemporary Muslim philosophers.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. disengage",
    optionB: "B. annotate",
    optionC: "C. buttress",
    optionD: "D. reciprocate",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the legitimacy of the reigns of French monarchs such as Hugh Capet and Henry I. As used in this context, “buttress” means to strengthen or defend. The text indicates that regardless of whether a French monarch’s reign was signicant or uneventful, each monarch faced questions about his right to the throne. The text goes on to say that in order to understand the path of a French monarch’s reign, it’s important to understand what contributed to the monarch’s ability to “hold the throne.” This context suggests that French monarchs such as Hugh Capet and Henry I had to buttress, or defend, their right to be monarch. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “disengage,” or withdraw his right to the French throne. The text focuses on an examination of people who reigned as French monarchs, not on people who didn’t choose to rule. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “annotate,” or add notes to or explain, his right to the French throne. Nothing in the text suggests that the monarchs were writing notes about their right to the throne; instead, faced with questions about the legitimacy of their reign, the monarchs defended their right. Choice D is incorrect. Saying that a monarch who is faced with questions about the legitimacy of his reign was able to “reciprocate” his right to the French throne would mean that he either returned his right to the throne or that he responded in kind to the challenge. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text focuses on people who did reign as French monarchs and defended their right to do so.",

      "Choice B is the best answer. “Indicator” means “something that shows or suggests,” which matches Taleb’s argument that an item’s age can suggest how much longer it will last. Choice A is incorrect. The passage tells us that examining an item’s age is the best way to predict how much longer it will last. Therefore, according to Taleb’s theory, an item’s age should add more certainty about how much longer it will last. Choice C is incorrect. A “motivation” is “a reason for doing.” Items don’t have feelings and motivations, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that their age is a motivation for how much longer they will last.

Credit sequences may not be exciting, but they generally ensure that everyone’s contributions are duly acknowledged. Because they are highly standardized, lm and television credits are also valuable to anyone researching the careers of pioneering cast and crew members who have worked in the mediums. Text 2 Video game scholars face a major challenge in the industry’s failure to consistently credit the artists, designers, and other contributors involved in making video games. Without a reliable record of which people worked on which games, questions about the medium’s development can be dicult to answer, and the accomplishments of all but its best-known innovators can be dicult to trace. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the discussion in Text 2?",

    optionD:
      "D. By observing that a widespread practice in lm and television largely prevents the kind of problem faced by the scholars mentioned in Text 2",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to Text 2 based on the information provided. Text 2 discusses how the inconsistent use of credits to identify the contributors to video games can pose an obstacle to scholars of the medium, who rely on such credits to answer questions about the medium’s development. Text 1 notes that in lm and television, on the other hand, credits are used consistently and are valuable to researchers studying the cast and crew members in these mediums. Since Text 1 asserts how the consistent use of credits benets scholars of lm and television, it can be inferred that this text’s author would respond to the discussion in Text 2 by observing that the kind of problem faced by scholars of video games—the inability to know who contributed to a particular production and how—is, in lm and television studies, largely prevented by the widespread practice of credits in these mediums. Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 1 discusses a method used by lm and television researchers—namely, relying on credits to research the careers of cast and crew members—the author doesn’t explicitly recommend that or any other method. Moreover, Text 1 states that lms and television shows themselves, not their researchers, regularly use the method of listing credits. Choice B is incorrect. It can be inferred from Text 2 that when video games do feature credits, they have essentially the same function as credits in lm and television—namely, to identify the individuals who worked on a particular production. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would characterize video game credits as differing in purpose from lm and television credits. Choice C is incorrect because, as Text 2 explains, credits are not consistently used in video games.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion of imported goods and consumer prices. In this context, "nullify" most nearly means negate or undermine. The text indicates that importing goods to a country can reduce consumer prices in that country, then cautions that the costs of transporting goods within the country is also a factor. These transportation costs likely raise the prices that must be paid by people who live far from the ports of entry. Therefore, the intranational transportation costs could nullify the price advantages to consumers of importing goods. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, "denigrate" would most nearly mean disparage or deny the importance of. Since transportation costs would not be capable of denying the importance of price advantages, it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs denigrate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "underestimate" would most nearly mean predict a lower value for, or to undervalue, someone or something. Though transportation costs might be undervalued, they cannot themselves undervalue something else, so it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs underestimate the price advantages of importing goods.

      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Carmen Lomas Garza’s artistic process. In this context, "inspired by" means inuenced by or motivated by. The text refers to how, regardless of the scale of the work, Garza uses her memories of Texas and details from California to create her art. If Garza is basing her work on her direct experiences, then they play a part in her artistic process. This context thus suggests that Garza’s art is inspired by the experiences of her childhood in Texas and her current life in California. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make logical sense to indicate that Garza is "complimented by"—or praised by—something inanimate such as direct experience. Choice B is incorrect because describing Garza as "uncertain about"—or unsure or doubtful of—direct experience would suggest that she had misgivings about it. If Garza were unsure of her experiences, that would suggest that she couldn’t recall them, and Garza wouldn’t be able to represent direct experience in her art if she were uncertain of the memories or details.

"Assigned" means "gave a job or duty." Newspapers do not have the power to assign people to move west, although they can encourage it. Choice C is incorrect. "Opposed" means "disapproved of." We can tell that this isn’t the case, because the newspapers discussed "the easy fortunes and high salaries miners could make in California" and "inspired readers to relocate." Choice D is incorrect. "Disregarded" means "ignored." If the newspapers are writing about the west and "inspir[ing] readers to relocate," they can’t be ignoring it at the same time.',

    question:
      "Like other tribal nations, the Muscogee (Creek) Nation is self-governing; its National Council generates laws regulating aspects of community life such as land use and healthcare, while the principal chief and cabinet ocials ______ those laws by devising policies and administering services in accordance with them. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. implement",
    optionB: "B. presume",
    optionC: "C. improvise",
    optionD: "D. mimic",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of self-government among the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. In this context, “implement” means to carry out or put into effect. The text states that the National Council generates laws, while the principal chief and cabinet ocials are responsible for “devising policies and administering services in accordance with” those laws. This context suggests that the principal chief and cabinet ocials implement the laws: they put the laws into effect by creating policies and administering services that accord with those laws. Choice B is incorrect because “presume” in this context would mean to assume based on incomplete information, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet ocials either made assumptions about the content of the laws or had incomplete information about them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “improvise” would mean to create something without preparation, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet ocials create policies and administer services without advance preparation. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the principal chief and cabinet ocials “mimic,” or imitate, the laws generated by the National Council. To mimic laws would mean to generate new laws that are imitations of existing laws, but the text indicates that the National Council, not the principal chief and cabinet ocials, is responsible for generating laws. Instead of generating laws, the principal chief and cabinet ocials put laws into effect by “devising policies and administering services in accordance with” the laws.",

Sara not only could tell stories, but she adored telling them. When she sat or stood in the midst of a circle and began to invent wonderful things, her green eyes grew big and shining, her cheeks ushed, and, without knowing that she was doing it, she began to act and made what she told lovely or alarming by the raising or dropping of her voice. As used in the text, what does the word “invent” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Mislead",
    optionB: "B. Disguise",
    optionC: "C. Create",
    optionD: "D. Discover",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, "invent" most nearly means create or make up. The text begins by stating that Sara likes to tell stories and thoroughly enjoys telling them. The rest of the text describes how she looks and acts when she invents, or creates, "wonderful things" in her stories ("what she told"). Choice A is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Sara makes up "wonderful things," nothing suggests that she does so to mislead, or intentionally deceive, others; there is no reason to assume that Sara’s listeners don’t know that she’s creating the stories she shares. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Sara is disguising, or trying to cover up or conceal, "wonderful things" when she tells stories; rather, she is creating them and presenting them in ways that make them "lovely or alarming" for her listeners. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Sara is discovering, or unexpectedly nding, "wonderful things" in the stories she loves to tell; rather, that she is making things up as she tells the stories.',

One of her most divisive works was an essay questioning the idea of photography as an emerging medium for ne art: in the essay, Eastlake ______ that the value of photographs was informational rather than creative. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. exposed",
    optionB: "B. asserted",
    optionC: "C. discovered",
    optionD: "D. doubted",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. "Asserted" means "stated condently." Eastlake "did not hesitate to publish reviews going against popular opinion," so we can assume that she was condent in sharing her opinions. Choice A is incorrect. "Exposed" means "made visible by uncovering" and, when talking about ideas, tends to be used in relation to uncovering the truth. Eastlake was sharing an opinion, not uncovering a truth. Choice C is incorrect. "Discovered" means "found," but Eastlake was writing an opinion essay. She was writing her own opinion, not "discovering" a new universal truth. Choice D is incorrect. "Doubted" means "didn’t believe in." We’re told that Eastlake "questioned" the idea that photography could be ne art. Placing "doubted" in the blank would actually suggest that Eastlake argued that photos were valuable for creativity and not for information, which is the opposite of what we were told she believes.',

Markita del Carpio Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to ______ this problem by transmitting molecules through carbon nanotubes, which can cross cell walls. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. conceptualize",
    optionB: "B. neglect",
    optionC: "C. illustrate",
    optionD: "D. overcome",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of delivering biomolecules to plant cells. In this context, “overcome” means to succeed in dealing with an obstacle. The text suggests that although it’s dicult to move biomolecules through plant cell walls, Landry and her colleagues have shown that carbon nanotubes may be useful, since they can cross cell walls. This context conveys that Landry and her colleagues think it’s possible, using carbon nanotubes, to succeed in dealing with the obstacle of transmitting biomolecules to plant cells. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to “conceptualize,” or form an idea of, the diculty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells. The text presents this diculty as a known problem that Landry and her colleagues think they may have solved, not as a mysterious occurrence that they have yet to form ideas about. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to successfully deal with the problem of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells, not that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to “neglect,” or simply to disregard and ignore the problem. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to “illustrate,” or demonstrate, the diculty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells by using carbon nanotubes. According to the text, carbon nanotubes allow molecules to be transmitted to plant cells—something that is otherwise dicult to do. The text therefore presents carbon nanotubes as a way of possibly solving a problem, not as a means of demonstrating the problem.",

    optionA: "A. prevail",
    optionB: "B. succumb",
    optionC: "C. diverge",
    optionD: "D. intersect",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about the relationship between ne art and fashion. As used in this context, “intersect” means to connect or overlap. The text indicates that Jamie Okuma challenges the position held by critics because her work can be seen at an art museum and can be bought by the public from her online boutique. The text also presents the critics’ view as being inuenced by a perception that ne artists create works that are “timeless” and meant for exhibition, whereas fashion designers periodically produce new styles that are meant for purchase. This context suggests that the critics believe that ne art and fashion tend not to overlap—in other words, that they rarely intersect. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that critics contend that ne art and fashion rarely “prevail,” or prove to be triumphant or widespread. The text indicates that Okuma is an example of an artist who demonstrates that it’s possible to make ne art that is also available to the public as fashion. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that ne art and fashion rarely “succumb,” or surrender. The text establishes that unlike what critics believe, Okuma creates works that are in art museums and available for the public to purchase, suggesting that critics believe ne art and fashion rarely overlap, not that they rarely succumb. Choice C is incorrect because saying that critics believe that ne art and fashion rarely “diverge,” or disagree or move in different directions, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text presents Okuma’s work as both ne art and fashion, thereby undermining what the critics assert. This suggests that the critics believe that ne art and fashion rarely intersect rather than that the two rarely diverge.",

    optionA: "A. full of",
    optionB: "B. drawn to",
    optionC: "C. responsible for",
    optionD: "D. distant from",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of manul cats. The text states that manul cats live in "out-of-the-way parts of Asia" (citing the famously remote Mount Everest as an example) and indicates that it is dicult to research the cats because of the location of their habitats. By emphasizing that the habitats are remote in relation to humans, the text conveys that being "distant from," or far from, large groups of humans makes manul cats challenging to study. Choice A is incorrect because saying that the habitats of manul cats are "full of large populations of humans" would indicate that the cats cohabitate with many humans, which would directly contradict the text’s claim that the cats live in "out-of-the-way" areas. Choice B is incorrect because the missing words describe an aspect of manul cats’ habitats, or the areas where they live, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that areas could be "drawn to," or attracted by, large groups of humans. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "responsible for" would mean either having an obligation to care for something or being the cause of something, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that the habitats of manul cats (the areas where the cats live) would need to care for humans or that the habitats somehow created large human populations.',

    optionA: "A. infrequent",
    optionB: "B. inexpensive",
    optionC: "C. unmistakable",
    optionD: "D. impractical",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of ways to detect people through walls. In this context, "inexpensive" means less costly or low in price. The passage describes two kinds of methods that can be used to "detect objects or people through walls": radar and sonar, and changes to the Wi-Fi technology used in smartphones. The word "comparatively" before the blank indicates that the best answer would be one that helps to describe a comparison between the two. Radar and sonar are described as "costly," while the method that uses Wi-Fi technology is described as "cheap"; therefore, it would be comparatively affordable, or inexpensive. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that a small modication to the smartphones that many consumers already own would presumably result in consumers using that technology to detect objects or people through walls more regularly, or frequently; therefore, it would not be true that such technology would be comparatively infrequent, or uncommon. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that either radar and sonar or changes to smartphone Wi-Fi technology are capable of being misunderstood or mistaken for something else; therefore, it would not make sense to describe changes to Wi-Fi smartphone technology as comparatively unmistakable, or indisputable. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that a small modication to the smartphones that many consumers already own and carry with them would be more functional or practical than radar and sonar, not more impractical, or unrealistic.',

In Canada and several Latin American countries, on the other hand, Indigenous people have formed their own political parties to advance candidates who will advocate for the interests of their communities. This movement has been particularly successful in Ecuador, where Guadalupe Llori, a member of the Indigenous party known as Pachakutik, was elected president of the National Assembly in 2021. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To trace the history of an Indigenous political movement and speculate about its future development",

      "C. To highlight two approaches to achieving political representation for Indigenous people",
    optionD:
      "D. To consider how Indigenous politicians in the United States have inuenced Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to illustrate two approaches that Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve political representation for their communities. The text begins by explaining that one approach is exemplied by Indigenous politicians in the United States who, in an effort to ensure that the interests of their communities are represented in government, joined preexisting political parties and were subsequently elected to Congress. The text goes on to highlight a second approach adopted by Indigenous leaders in Canada and several Latin American countries: rather than joining established political parties, many Indigenous politicians in these countries have instead formed their own parties to promote candidates for oce who support causes that are important to their communities. Choice A is incorrect because the text’s focus is on the contrasting approaches adopted by different Indigenous political movements in different countries; thus, it isn’t accurate to say that the text traces the history of one political movement. Moreover, the text only discusses examples from 2000 to 2021, a relatively short period of time; therefore, it provides very little in the way of discussion of larger historical developments, nor does it make any predictions about how these movements might continue to develop in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the text never urges Indigenous politicians in the US to alter their strategy of striving for representation through the established political parties, nor does it suggest that this strategy is inferior to that of Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America, who have formed their own parties. In fact, the text notes that both strategies have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians to national governments. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that Indigenous politicians in the US have inuenced those in Canada and Latin America; instead, it stresses how Indigenous politicians’ approach toward achieving representation in the US government has differed from the approach Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve representation in national governments elsewhere in the Americas.",

    optionD: "D. It presents a character feeling regret over leaving home.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The narrator describes how Joe responds to being in “the metropolis”: he’s excited and “wild with enthusiasm.” He also envies the young fellows who walk by because, dressed as they are, they look as if they have somewhere special to go. The text contrasts this new place with the place Joe comes from, where apparently there wasn’t as much to do. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Joe’s reaction to a new environment. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to why Joe has moved. The narrator indicates that Joe is enthusiastic about being in a city, but there’s no explanation provided for the move. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no reference to how Joe thinks about an event. The narrator describes young men passing by in the evening and then recalls places worth going to at home—church and a few people’s houses—but there’s no explicit comparison made nor is a time of day mentioned for these events back home.

    optionB: "B. inactive",
    optionC: "C. liked",
    optionD: "D. distressed",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of oysters and ocean recordings. As used in this context, "responsive" means reacting positively. The text presents a nding and describes it as suggesting that healthy ocean sounds may encourage oyster larvae to establish a reef (a permanent home): groups of oyster larvae that heard recorded sounds of a healthy oyster reef were two times more likely to show signs of forming their own reef than groups that heard different ocean recordings were. This context conveys that the groups that heard healthy reef sounds had a more positive reaction than the other groups did—that is, they were the most responsive. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to become "inactive," or to stop engaging in work or activity. Instead, the text conveys that the groups that heard those sounds were observed engaging in activity: they were two times more likely to create a reef (a permanent home) than groups that heard different ocean sounds were. Choice C is incorrect because describing the groups of oyster larvae that heard sounds of a healthy oyster reef as most "liked," or regarded with pleasure, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that a study found that healthy reef sounds may encourage groups of oyster larvae to form reefs (permanent homes), not on the idea that some of the groups in the study were liked more than others. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to be "distressed," or to experience diculty or begin to decline.

      'Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "determine" most nearly means choose or decide. The text indicates that Mr. Ryder "had made up his mind" to ask a woman to marry him but had not yet "spoken"—that is, he had not yet asked her. The text also indicates that Mr. Ryder "decided" to throw a party for the woman and ask her during it. This context conveys that after making up his mind to propose, what Mr. Ryder had to do was determine, or choose, the time to do it. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "determine" doesn’t mean inuence, or affect or control. The text isn’t indicating that Mr. Ryder is controlling time itself; such a thing isn’t possible. Rather, the text conveys that after making up his mind to ask a woman to marry him, Mr. Ryder had to make another decision about his own actions by selecting a time to propose. Choice C is incorrect.

    optionB: "B. enthusiasm for",
    optionC: "C. concern about",
    optionD: "D. surprise at",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Cole’s book Blind Spot. In this context, “enthusiasm for” means excitement about. The text explains that Blind Spot consists of original photographs as well as poetic prose—two elements that correspond to Cole’s passions, identied in the text, for photography and the written word. This context suggests that Cole’s excitement about photography and writing led him to create a book that successfully combines the two mediums. Choice A is incorrect because describing Cole as feeling “indifference to” his two passions wouldn’t make sense in context. If Cole is indifferent to his passions, that would mean he doesn’t care about photography or writing—in which case they wouldn’t be his passions at all. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels “concern about,” or uneasiness about, his passions. The text’s use of the word “culminates” indicates that Blind Spot represents a triumphant climax of Cole’s passions, not a work that results from his sense of discomfort with photography and writing. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels “surprise at,” or astonished by, his passions. The text indicates that Cole’s feeling about his passions “culminates” in a book that “evocatively” combines photographs and writing, suggesting that Cole has a long-standing and skillful relationship to his passions, not that he is startled by them.",

In hours of toil it gives me zest, And when at eve I long for rest; When cows come home along the bars, And in the fold I hear the bell, As Night, the shepherd, herds his stars, I sing my song, and all is well. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA: "A. To convey how engaging in song makes the speaker feel",
    optionB: "B. To compare the speaker to a singing shepherd",
    optionC: "C. To portray the speaker’s excitement about farming",
    optionD: "D. To describe the pieces of music the speaker enjoys hearing",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because is accurately states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by declaring that although a song is "but a little thing," or seemingly insignicant, singing it brings joy and gives the speaker of the text "zest," or excitement, in "hours of toil." The remainder of the text explores the idea that as night is falling, singing allows the speaker to feel that "all is well." Thus, the main purpose of the text is to convey how engaging in song makes the speaker feel. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions a shepherd, it neither indicates that the shepherd is singing nor does it compare the shepherd to the speaker. Choice C is incorrect. The text indicates that the speaker works hard, engaging in "hours of toil," and it can be inferred that the speaker likely lives in a rural area, since cows and a cowbell can be heard nearby. However, the text does not suggest that the speaker is a farmer or feels excited about farming. Moreover, the shepherd in the text is not a literal reference to someone who herds sheep but instead a gurative description of the moon as the shepherd of the stars. Choice D is incorrect because in the text, the speaker is singing a song, not listening to others sing one. Moreover, the text describes the feelings that the speaker has when singing a song, not the song itself.',

    question:
      "The work of Kiowa painter T.C. Cannon derives its power in part from the tension among his ______ inuences: classic European portraiture, with its realistic treatment of faces; the American pop art movement, with its vivid colors; and atstyle, the intertribal painting style that rejects the effect of depth typically achieved through shading and perspective. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. complementary",
    optionB: "B. unknown",
    optionC: "C. disparate",
    optionD: "D. interchangeable",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the artistic styles that have inuenced Cannon’s work. As used in this context, “disparate” means distinct or dissimilar. The text indicates that a tension exists among the styles that have inuenced Cannon’s work and goes on to describe how those styles differ: classic European portraiture favors realism, American pop art uses vivid colors, and intertribal atstyle rejects the use of shading and perspective to achieve depth. This context suggests that the styles that have inuenced Cannon’s work are disparate. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the inuences on Cannon’s artwork, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that the inuences are “complementary,” or that they complete one another or make up for one another’s deciencies. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to characterize Cannon’s inuences as “unknown,” or not familiar; it’s clear that the inuences are known because the text goes on to list them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the inuences on Cannon’s work, not that they are “interchangeable,” or capable of being used in one another’s place.",

    question:
      "San Francisco is known for the colorful murals painted on many of its buildings. The densest collection of murals is found on Balmy Alley in the Mission District neighborhood. In the 1970s, Latina artists painted vivid scenes of community life on walls along this block. As the original murals have faded, later generations of artists have painted new ones over them. As a result, Balmy Alley has become a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit, with its murals reecting changes in the cultural life of the city. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To compare the Balmy Alley murals to other murals in San Francisco",
    optionB:
      "B. To offer an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals",
    optionC:
      "C. To urge people to protect the murals of San Francisco from decay",
    optionD:
      "D. To describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco beginning in the 1970s",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by briey stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city’s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are signicant because they reect San Francisco’s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals. Choice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn’t specically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specic collection of murals—or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as “a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit,” the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specic area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District.",

    optionC:
      "C. To warn a child that he will face many challenges throughout his life",
    optionD:
      "D. To encourage a child to embrace the experiences life will offer",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately states the text’s main purpose. The poem begins with the speaker urging a child to “go forth” with her encouragement (“my heart’s desire”). The speaker goes on to suggest that new experiences (“Great reaches, yet unknown”) lie ahead for the son that “life is calling” him to seek out. Thus, the main purpose is to encourage a child to embrace the experiences available to him in his life. Choice A is incorrect because the speaker encourages the child to pursue new experiences (“Great reaches”) without knowing exactly what those experiences will be (“yet unknown”) or suggesting that they should match the speaker’s own accomplishments. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker focuses on positive possibilities for her son (“Great reaches, yet unknown”) and her enthusiastic encouragement to embrace those possibilities (“life is calling you!”), while there is no mention of raising a child or associated struggles. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker frames the possibilities for her son in a positive light when she says that “great reaches, yet unknown” are waiting for him, and this positive outlook for the son is consistent throughout the text.",

Alice, a child, is talking to her cat. “Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just as if someone was kissing the window all over outside.” As used in the text, what does the word “soft” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Gentle",
    optionB: "B. Sensitive",
    optionC: "C. Shapeless",
    optionD: "D. Bland",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "soft" most nearly means gentle. The text portrays Alice speaking about the snow falling against the window, describing it as sounding "nice" and similar to someone "kissing the window." These details most strongly suggest that Alice thinks the sound made by the snow falling against the window is gentle. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "gentle" can mean sensitive, or caring about others’ feelings, that isn’t the meaning in this context; it doesn’t make sense to say that Alice thinks the sound of the snow cares about anything. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is shapeless, or lacks a denite shape; she isn’t indicating how anything looks or feels but, rather, is describing how "nice" and gentle the snow sounds. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is bland, or uninteresting; rather, she notices the sound and comments on how "nice" it is.',

Among the wild rice in the still lagoon, In monotone the lizard shrills his tune. The wild goose, homing, seeks a sheltering, Where rushes grow, and oozing lichens cling. Late cranes with heavy wing, and lazy ight, Sail up the silence with the nearing night. And like a spirit, swathed in some soft veil, Steals twilight and its shadows o’er the swale.

Choice A is incorrect. Instead of simply naming species, the text presents descriptive images of nature; further, instead of naming animals and then moving on to name plants, the text refers rst to a plant ("the wild rice"), then to two animals ("the lizard," "the wild goose"), then to another plant ("rushes"), and so on. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not draw any comparison between nature and human emotions; it does not refer to human emotions at all. Choice D is incorrect.

British forces were burning nearby Danbury, Connecticut, and Ludington wanted to rally rebel troops to meet them. Although she was only 16 years old at the time, her brave feat made Ludington one of the heroes of the American Revolution. Since then, Ludington has been widely celebrated, inspiring postage stamps, statues, and even children’s TV series. Text 2 Historian Paula D. Hunt researched the life and legacy of Sybil Ludington but found no evidence for her famous ride. Although many articles and books have been written about Ludington, Hunt believes writers may have been inventing details about Ludington as they retold her story. Ludington is revered by Americans today, but there simply isn’t a strong historical record of her heroic ride. Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",

    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of studies of altitude’s effect on blood chemistry. In this context, “paucity of” means lack of. In describing the inspiration behind Al-Sweedan and Alhaj’s research, the text uses the word “though” to suggest a contrasting relationship between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. This contrasting relationship and the text’s use of the word “many” provide context suggesting that there are few, if any, examples of the second type of study, whereas there are numerous examples of the rst type. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for there to be a “quarrel about,” or open disagreement about, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text’s use of the words “though” and “many” suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. There’s nothing in the text to suggest that the contrast between the two types of studies involves the extent to which researchers broadly agree or disagree about the contents of either type. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for there to be a “profusion of,” or great abundance of, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text’s use of the words “though” and “many” suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. Rather than logically completing this contrast, “profusion of” would indicate that the two types of studies are similar in terms of amount, with many examples existing of both types.

For the cover of her album Turbulent Indigo (1994), Mitchell painted a striking self-portrait that closely resembles Vincent van Gogh’s Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear (1889). The image calls attention to the album’s title song, in which Mitchell sings about the legacy of the postimpressionist painter. In that song, Mitchell also hints that she feels a strong artistic connection to Van Gogh—an idea that is reinforced by her imagery on the cover.

    optionB: "B. reciprocates",
    optionC: "C. retaliates",
    optionD: "D. deviates",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of ectomycorrhizae relationships. In this context, “reciprocates” means responds in kind or degree. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is “mutually benecial” and involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. In other words, each organism provides the same kind of benet it receives: the tree provides a nutrient (carbon) for the fungus and the fungus reciprocates by helping the tree to absorb more of another nutrient (nitrogen). Choice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Nothing in the text suggests that the fungus “overreacts,” or responds too strongly, by allowing the tree to be better able to absorb a benecial nutrient. Choice C is incorrect because “retaliates” means responds to a harmful action with a similarly harmful action. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is “mutually benecial” and involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other, not that the relationship is one in which the organisms harm one another. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “deviates” would mean departs from an established course or norm. The text explains that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Because the relationship involves benets for both the fungus and the tree, it wouldn’t make sense to say that the fungus deviates by helping the tree be better able to absorb a benecial nutrient.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it best states how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence states that Tule geese typically take four days to migrate south.

The rest of the text details the remainder of the geese’s typical journey and then mentions circumstances in 2020 that resulted in the geese taking an unusually long time to complete it. Thus, the underlined portion describes part of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration journey. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text concludes by stating that in 2020, Tule geese took twice as long to complete their typical migration, which suggests a change in their usual ight behavior, the underlined portion doesn’t discuss this.

Rather, the text mentions Alaska to explain that it’s the starting point of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the dating of Machu Picchu. In this context, "original" means rst or initial. The text indicates that Lucy Salazar and her colleagues have determined the age of Machu Picchu and that the age differs from another estimate of the site’s age, explaining that the site is about 20 years older than scholars thought in 1911 when they initially encountered Machu Picchu. In other words, Salazar and her team found that the site’s age differs from the rst estimate. Choice A is incorrect. The text’s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they rst encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. It wouldn’t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was "genuine," or actual and true, while the one by Salazar’s team wasn’t, since the text treats the nding by Salazar’s team as true and as invalidating the earlier estimate ("it is approximately 20 years older than scholars thought"). Choice B is incorrect.

It wouldn’t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was "intentional," or done on purpose, while the one by Salazar’s team wasn’t; the text indicates that Salazar and her colleagues were deliberately using radiocarbon dating to study Machu Picchu. Choice C is incorrect. The text’s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they rst encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. There’s no reason to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was "independent," or not controlled by or aliated with others, while the one by Salazar’s team wasn’t; there’s no mention of any outside inuence on the work by Salazar and her team or by scholars in 1911.',

    question:
      "For his 1986 album Keyboard Fantasies, Beverly Glenn-Copeland wrote songs grounded in traditional soul and folk music, then accompanied them with futuristic synthesizer arrangements featuring ambient sounds and complex rhythms. The result was so strange, so unprecedented, that the album attracted little attention when rst released. In recent years, however, a younger generation of musicians has embraced the stylistic experimentation of Keyboard Fantasies. Alternative R&B musicians Blood Orange and Moses Sumney, among other contemporary recording artists, cite the album as an inuence. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?",
    optionA:
      "A. It urges contemporary musicians to adopt the unique sound of Keyboard Fantasies.",
    optionB:
      "B. It responds to criticism of Keyboard Fantasies by some younger musicians.",
    optionC:
      "C. It offers examples of younger musicians whose work has been impacted by Keyboard Fantasies.",
    optionD:
      "D. It contrasts Keyboard Fantasies with the recordings of two younger musicians.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole. The text’s subject is Beverly GlennCopeland’s 1986 album Keyboard Fantasies, notable for its innovative, experimental arrangements. According to the text, the album was not initially admired, but in recent years it has become popular among younger musicians. The underlined portion of the text mentions two of those musicians, Blood Orange and Moses Sumney, who “cite the album as an inuence.” Therefore, the underlined portion of the text offers examples of younger musicians whose work has been impacted by Keyboard Fantasies. Choice A is incorrect because even though the underlined sentence states that Blood Orange and Moses Sumney were inuenced by Keyboard Fantasies, it doesn’t say that all other musicians should also embrace the album’s experimental style. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Keyboard Fantasies was not admired on its rst release, the text doesn’t present any criticism of the album by younger musicians: it only presents two younger musicians who cite it as an inuence. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t mention any differences between Keyboard Fantasies and the work of Blood Orange and Moses Sumney.",

      "Eighteenth-century historian Edward Gibbon thought the only character defect of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius was his mild temperament—though the emperor was widely considered virtuous, his overly permissive nature led him to ______ the vices of those who surrounded him. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. indulge",
    optionB: "B. despise",
    optionC: "C. moderate",
    optionD: "D. criticize",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. In this context, "indulge" means treat with excessive leniency. The text states that according to historian Edward Gibbon, Marcus Aurelius, who was widely considered virtuous, had only a single character aw: his mild temperament. The text suggests that because of this aw, Marcus Aurelius had an overly permissive nature. This context, in turn, supports the idea that Marcus Aurelius treated the vices, or evils, of those around him with excessive leniency, indulging rather than punishing those vices. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Marcus Aurelius was widely considered virtuous, it gives no indication that he was inclined to "despise," or hate, others’ vices. Rather, the text suggests that he showed undue tolerance for these vices because of his overly permissive nature—that is, his inclination to allow others to do as they wished. Choice C is incorrect because the text’s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others’ vices, not that he tried to "moderate" those vices, or lessen their intensity. Choice D is incorrect because the text’s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others’ vices, not that he attempted to "criticize," or speak disapprovingly of, those vices.',

These variations suggest that the work may be that of a student under Vermeer’s tutelage—potentially ______ our understanding of Vermeer as a solitary artist. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. negating",
    optionB: "B. preguring",
    optionC: "C. entrenching",
    optionD: "D. substantiating",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. "Negating" means "reversing" or "making invalid." Proving that Vermeer worked with students would reverse the view of him as a solitary artist. Choice B is incorrect. "Preguring" means "being an early indicator of." There already existed views of Vermeer as a solitary painter, so a new painting would not be an early indicator of those views. Rather, a painting proving that Vermeer had a student would contradict those earlier views. Choice C is incorrect. "Entrenching" means "solidifying." A painting proving that Vermeer had a student would not solidify views of him as solitary, but would rather contradict those views. Choice D is incorrect. "Substantiating" means "supporting with proof." A painting proving that Vermeer had a student would not support views of him as solitary, but would rather contradict those views.',

    optionD: "D. accessible",
    correctAnswer: 3,

      "Choice D is the best answer. When talking about a thing, “accessible” means “easy to understand.” This sets up the contrast in the next sentence, which tells us that critics mostly focus on art that is “cryptic or challenging” (meaning not easy to understand).

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. forgetting",
    optionB: "B. rejection",
    optionC: "C. imitation",
    optionD: "D. opinion",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of novelist Leon Forrest’s admiration of William Faulkner’s writing style. In this context, "imitation" means something that resembles or reproduces something else. The text states that Forrest admired Faulkner’s style and that anyone familiar with Faulkner’s style would be able to see the stylistic similarities between a particular passage in Forrest’s novel Divine Days and Faulkner’s writing, a fact that supports the idea that Forrest’s novel pays tribute to Faulkner by reproducing, or imitating, Faulkner’s style. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, a "forgetting" would mean an instance in which something is overlooked or not remembered. The text emphasizes Forrest’s admiration for Faulkner’s style and the fact that Forrest’s writing in some instances closely resembles Faulkner’s stylistically. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that in trying to pay tribute to Faulkner’s style, Forrest failed to remember it. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, a "rejection" would mean a dismissal of something as unworthy. The text emphasizes Forrest’s admiration for Faulkner’s writing style, stating that parts of Forrest’s writings indicate efforts to copy that style. It wouldn’t make sense therefore to suggest that Forrest had rejected or dismissed Faulkner’s style as unworthy. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, an "opinion" would mean a view or judgment. Although the text focuses on Forrest’s admiration of Faulkner, which suggests that Forrest had formed a positive judgment of Faulkner’s style, the word opinion wouldn’t make sense in this sentence: the sentence doesn’t say that the passage from Forrest’s novel expresses his view of Faulkner’s style; rather, it suggests that stylistically, the passage closely resembles, or imitates, Faulkner’s writing.',

    optionA: "A. surpassed by",
    optionB: "B. comparable to",
    optionC: "C. independent of",
    optionD: "D. obtained from",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the fossilized bones of the hominin known as Little Foot. As used in this context, “comparable to” would mean similar to. The text indicates that the relationship between the fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones of Little Foot and the clavicle and shoulder bones of “frequent climbers,” such as chimpanzees and gorillas, suggests that Little Foot had adapted to moving around in trees. This context suggests that the relationship between the fossilized bones of Little Foot and the bones of chimpanzees and gorillas is one of similarity—the Little Foot fossils are likely comparable to the modern ape bones. Choice A is incorrect because if the fossilized bones of Little Foot were “surpassed by,” or exceeded by or made inferior to, the bones of modern apes that are frequent climbers, it wouldn’t suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees. If anything, learning that Little Foot’s clavicle and shoulder bones were surpassed by those of chimpanzees and gorillas would suggest that Little Foot was poorly adapted to climbing. Choice C is incorrect because if Little Foot’s fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones were “independent of,” or not inuenced by or aliated with, the bones of modern apes that climb often, it wouldn’t suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees.

    optionA: "A. multifaceted",
    optionB: "B. realistic",
    optionC: "C. rousing",
    optionD: "D. subtle",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the play’s effect on audiences. As used in this context, “rousing” means exciting or energizing. The text indicates that critics found the play to have “the opposite effect” on audiences of what the playwrights hoped for. The critics, the text says, thought the play was wearying rather than energizing to viewers. This context supports the idea that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be energizing, or rousing, to audiences. Choice A is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be “multifaceted,” or be varied or have many aspects. The text indicates that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Multifaceted is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing. Choice B is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be “realistic,” or lifelike or sensible. The text says that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Realistic is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be subtle, or complex or understated. The text says that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Subtle is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing.",

    optionB: "B. Questioned",
    optionC: "C. Approved",
    optionD: "D. Ignored",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "featured" most nearly means displayed. The text describes Nina’s fascination with a framed photograph. It then goes on to describe what the photograph showed, or displayed, which is a portrait of Nina’s great-great-grandmother Rosita as a young woman. Thus, the text indicates that the photograph displayed a portrait of Rosita. Choice B is incorrect because the text identies the person shown in the photograph as Nina’s great-great-grandmother; it gives no indication that the contents of the photograph were questioned, or asked about. Choice C is incorrect because approved means expressed a favorable opinion of, and there’s nothing to suggest that the photograph of Nina’s great-great-grandmother has received approval or been viewed favorably, only that Nina is unable to stop looking at it.

    question:
      "Text 1 The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event is usually attributed solely to an asteroid impact near Chicxulub, Mexico. Some scientists argue that volcanic activity was the true cause, as the K-Pg event occurred relatively early in a long period of eruption of the Deccan Traps range that initially produced huge amounts of climate-altering gases. These dissenters note that other mass extinctions have coincided with large volcanic eruptions, while only the K-Pg event lines up with an asteroid strike. Text 2 In a 2020 study, Pincelli Hull and her colleagues analyzed ocean core samples and modeled climate changes around the K-Pg event. The team concluded that Deccan Traps gases did affect global conditions prior to the event, but that the climate returned to normal well before the extinctions began—extinctions that instead closely align with the Chicxulub impact. Based on the texts, how would Hull’s team (Text 2) most likely respond to the argument in the underlined portion of Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By agreeing that the Chicxulub impact changed the climate and that the Deccan Traps eruption caused the K-Pg event",
    optionB:
      "B. By declaring that the changes in climate caused by the Deccan Traps eruption weren’t the main cause of the K-Pg event",
    optionC:
      "C. By questioning why those scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps eruption",
    optionD:
      "D. By asserting that the Deccan Traps eruption had a more signicant effect on global conditions than those scientists claim",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it describes how Hull’s team would most likely respond to the argument in the underlined portion of Text 1, which asserts that volcanic activity in the Deccan Traps range led to changes in the climate and caused the K-Pg mass extinction event. According to Text 2, although Hull’s team found that activity in the Deccan Traps did indeed alter the climate before the K-Pg event, the team determined that the climate had returned to normal before mass extinctions began. This nding and the observation that the K-Pg extinctions closely align with the Chicxulub asteroid impact suggest that Hull’s team would likely dispute the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 and say that the climate changes caused by the Deccan Traps activity were not the main cause of the extinctions. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull’s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull’s team would disagree that the Deccan Traps activity caused the K-Pg event. Additionally, the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 says nothing about how the Chicxulub impact changed the climate, so while Hull’s team might believe that the impact did in fact change the climate, they could not be said to agree with the claim in Text 1 on this point. Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication in either text that any scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps activity, so there is no reason to conclude that Hull’s team would question why the scientists referred to in Text 1 make such an assumption. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull’s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull’s team would say that the Deccan Traps activity had a less enduring effect on global conditions than the scientists referenced in Text 1 believe, not that the effect on global conditions was more signicant than those scientists claim.",

That would imply that Tinker-Smith initially faced some kind of obstacle or opposition, and nothing like that is mentioned in the passage. Choice C is incorrect.

    optionB: "B. ornamental",
    optionC: "C. obscure",
    optionD: "D. intricate",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Three Sisters intercropping system. As used in this context, “intricate” would mean made up of complexly related elements. The text indicates that in the Three Sisters system, maize, squash, and beans form a “web of relations” in which the crops interact in various ways. The text’s description of these interactions—the bean vines growing on the maize stalks, the squash vines keeping weeds away, and the beans adding nutrients that the maize and squash use—provides context suggesting that this “web of relations” is intricate. Choice A is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as “indecipherable,” or impossible to comprehend, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text’s description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not indecipherable. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the practical benets that each plant in the Three Sisters system provides to other members of the system, showing that the relationship among the crops that make up the system is not “ornamental,” or mainly serving a decorative purpose.

Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t consider whether Native art is controversial, or causes disagreement or discussion; instead, the text discusses the stylistic diversity of the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some of the artists whose work is represented in the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian blend various artistic traditions into highly individual styles of their own, this is not the primary focus of the text. Instead, the text is concerned with how Native art is often mistakenly perceived as uniform, when in fact it is stylistically diverse. Choice C is incorrect because the text never implies that people mistakenly conceive of Native art as theoretical, or concerned with philosophical or abstract issues; instead, the text’s discussion of Native art is framed around this art’s stylistic diversity versus the misconception of it as homogenous.',

    question:
      "The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde’s 1895 play The Importance of Being Earnest. CECILY: Have we got to part? ALGERNON: I am afraid so. It’s a very painful parting. CECILY: It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very brief space of time. The absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable. As used in the text, what does the word “endure” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Regret",
    optionB: "B. Persist",
    optionC: "C. Tolerate",
    optionD: "D. Encourage",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “endure” most nearly means tolerate. In the text, Cecily and Algernon discuss parting, or saying goodbye. Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known briey and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable. Choice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “endure” can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist despite the absence of someone else, one can’t persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent. Although it may be that Cecily prefers new acquaintances to friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses on her feelings as a result of others’ absences, not on her treatment of others.",

In the rst half of the text, the speaker describes our attempts to control nature: cultivating, taming, and irrigating different kinds of land. In the second half, the speaker states that we can never tame the sea or the beach. Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t describe the overall structure of the text.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft’s contact with the asteroid 101955 Bennu. In this context, “collected” means acquired and took away. The text indicates that although the boulders on the asteroid’s surface caused some unforeseen problems, OSIRIS-REx was able to gather a sample to return to Earth. This context suggests that OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample of 101955 Bennu. Choice A is incorrect because in this context “attached” means connected or axed. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth; it doesn’t suggest that the spacecraft attached anything to the asteroid. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “followed” means tracked or traveled behind and the text discusses OSIRIS-REx’s brief encounter with 101955 Bennu during which the spacecraft gathered a sample to bring to Earth. The text doesn’t suggest that the spacecraft tracked the sample, and it’s not clear what it would mean for the spacecraft to travel behind the sample it collected.

    question:
      "Text 1 For decades, bluegrass musicians have debated whether their genre should exclude inuences from mainstream genres such as rock. Many insist that bluegrass is dened by its adherence to the folk music of the US South, out of which bluegrass emerged. Such “purists,” as they are known, regard the recordings of Bill Monroe, which established the bluegrass sound in the 1940s, as a standard against which the genre should still be measured. Text 2 Bluegrass isn’t simply an extension of folk traditions into the era of recorded music. In reality, Bill Monroe created the bluegrass sound in the 1940s by combining Southern folk music with commercial genres that had arisen only a few decades before, such as jazz and the blues. Since bluegrass has always been a mixed genre, contemporary bluegrass musicians should not be forbidden from incorporating into it inuences from rock and other mainstream genres. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely regard the perspective of bluegrass purists, as described in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. As inconsistent, since bluegrass purists themselves enjoy other musical genres",
    optionB:
      "B. As unrealistic, since bluegrass purists have no way of enforcing their musical preferences",
    optionC:
      "C. As shortsighted, because bluegrass could enlarge its audience by including inuences from mainstream genres",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 3,

      "Choice D is the best answer. According to Author 1, the “purists” argue that bluegrass should stick to its folk music roots. But Author 2 points out that this isn’t how bluegrass emerged: it actually got its sound from a mix of folk, jazz, and blues. Choice A is incorrect. There’s nothing in Text 2 about what other genres the purists enjoy, so this inference about Author 2’s views isn’t supported. Choice B is incorrect. There’s nothing in Text 2 about whether or how purists can enforce their preferences, so this inference about Author 2’s views isn’t supported. Choice C is incorrect.

    question:
      "Text 1 Stage lighting theorist Adolphe Appia was perhaps the rst to argue that light must be considered alongside all the various elements of a stage to create a single, unied performance. Researcher Kelly Bremner, however, has noted that Appia lacked technical expertise in the use of light in the theater. As a result of Appia’s inexperience, Bremner argues, Appia’s theory of light called for lighting practices that weren’t possible until after the advent of electricity around 1881. Text 2 Adolphe Appia was not an amateur in the practice of lighting. Instead, it is precisely his exposure to lighting techniques at the time that contributed to his theory on the importance of light. When working as an apprentice for a lighting specialist in his youth, Appia observed the use of portable lighting devices that could be operated by hand. This experience developed his understanding of what was possible in the coordination of elements on the stage. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claim about Appia’s level of technical expertise made by Bremner in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. Many lighting technicians dismissed Appia’s ideas about light on the stage.",
    optionB:
      "B. Appia likely gained a level of technical expertise during his time as an apprentice.",
    optionC:
      "C. Theater practitioners who worked with Appia greatly admired his work.",
    optionD:
      "D. Appia was unfamiliar with the use of music and sound in theater.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. The author of Text 2 directly contradicts Bremner’s claim that Appia lacked technical expertise by stating that Appia was “not an amateur in the practice of lighting.” His experience as a lighting specialist’s apprentice would have, the author of Text 2 argues, allowed Appia to “[develop] his understanding of what was possible” with the elements of theatrical design. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text describes how other lighting technicians responded to Appia’s ideas. Furthermore, this claim isn’t relevant to Bremner’s evaluation of Appia’s technical expertise. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text mentions anything about the opinions of theater practitioners who worked with Appia, so this answer choice does not relate to the claim about Appia’s level of technical expertise made by Bremner in Text 1.

In 2020, Jianqiang Wu and his colleagues determined that the tiny dodder achieves this ______ with its host by absorbing and utilizing a protein the host produces when it is about to ower. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. synchronization",
    optionB: "B. hibernation",
    optionC: "C. prediction",
    optionD: "D. moderation",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of a relationship between the dodder plant and its host plant. As used in this context, “synchronization” means the act of things happening at the same time. The text indicates that the dodder and its host plant ower in unison and that this synchronization occurs because the dodder makes use of a protein produced by the host shortly before owering. Choice B is incorrect because referring to “hibernation,” or the state of being dormant or inactive, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on something the dodder plant actively engages in—making use of a protein and producing owers. Choice C is incorrect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage together in “prediction,” or the act of declaring or indicating something in advance, wouldn’t make sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant make a prediction about owering activity, the text suggests that the host produces a protein as part of its regular owering process and that the dodder then absorbs and uses that protein to ower at the same time. Choice D is incorrect because referring to “moderation,” or the act of causing something to become less intense or extreme, wouldn’t make sense in context. Although the text states that the dodder plant absorbs and uses a protein made by its host plant, it doesn’t suggest that the dodder lessens the host plant’s owering activity; the two plants simply ower in unison.",

Text 2 Researchers from NASA’s Ames Research Center used a computer to model how the moon could have formed. Although simulations of the moon’s formation have been done in the past, the team from NASA ran simulations that were much more detailed. They found that the formation of the moon was likely not a slow process that took many years. Instead, it’s probable that the moon’s formation happened immediately after impact, taking just a few hours. Which choice best describes a difference in how the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 view the evidence for the formation of the moon?",

    optionD:
      "D. The author of Text 1 believes that the moon formed more slowly than the author of Text 2 believes.",

      "Choice D is the best answer. Text 1 states that the moon was formed from the debris “over the course of thousands of years,” while Text 2 states that the moon’s formation happened “immediately after impact, taking just a few hours.” This shows a clear difference in how the authors view the evidence for the speed of the moon’s formation. Choice A is incorrect. While Text 2 suggests that the moon formed over “just a few hours” and Text 1 says it took “thousands of years,” neither one mentions when that formation occurred.

    optionA: "A. Joining with",
    optionB: "B. Gaining on",
    optionC: "C. Stretching toward",
    optionD: "D. Arriving at",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text "reaching across to" most nearly means stretching toward. The text begins with Mrs. Wilkins stating that she wants to have one of the oranges that she’s admiring. The text then indicates that Mrs. Wilkins, staying where she is, holds out a big orange to her friend. This context suggests that when the text describes Mrs. Wilkins as reaching across to the bowl of oranges, it means that she is stretching toward the bowl. Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is joining with, or becoming attached to, the bowl of oranges. Rather, the text indicates that she is stretching toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is gaining on, or overtaking in a competition or race, the bowl of oranges. The text suggests instead that the bowl is sitting still on a surface and that Mrs. Wilkins is extending her arm toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Mrs. Wilkins is arriving at the bowl of oranges. In fact, the text states that Mrs. Wilkins stays where she is when reaching across to the bowl, meaning that she remains at a distance from it.',

The text presents this information about the seven-day week as an example of a concept introduced by the Sumerian civilization that persists into present-day civilizations. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Sumerian civilization “transformed,” or changed the nature of, concepts that persist into presentday civilizations.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The narrator asserts that she loves both her “own” country (Japan) and her “adopted country” (the United States) even though the two countries differ “widely.” She also indicates that, at rst, she would try to explain unfamiliar experiences that she had in the United States using the standards ingrained in her from growing up in Japan. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to convey the narrator’s experience of observing and making sense of the differences between two cultures she embraces. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to possible companions. Although the text does indicate that the narrator sometimes used the cultural framework she acquired growing up in Japan to explain some experiences she’s had, there is no suggestion that this was in service of making friends. And although “no one seemed to know” strongly implies that the narrator has interacted with other people in the United States, there is no indication that these conversations involved her discussing Japanese customs. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator was hesitant to ask questions. In fact, the narrator indicates that “no one seemed to know the origin” of various customs, which provides evidence that, rather than being hesitant, she sought information from several people. Choice D is incorrect because the text makes no reference to the physical distance between Japan and the United States. Although the narrator indicates that the two countries differ “widely” and likens them to “two separate worlds,” these descriptions relate to cultural aspects of the countries and the narrator’s feelings about the two countries, not the physical distance between them.",

      "Choice D is the best answer. The text starts by introducing Mitchell’s philosophy about using simple, repetitive language in books for young children. Then it describes a book inuenced by that philosophy, Goodnight Moon. Choice A is incorrect. Although two authors are mentioned in the text, they both agree about the type of language that should be contained in books for young children. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the evaluation of children’s literature. It does provide one view of how children’s books should be written, but never introduces a competing view. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t mention “many classics of children’s literature.” Instead, it describes an educational theory and identies one example of a famous children’s book that was inuenced by that theory.",

      "As an architect in Los Angeles in the 1950s, Helen Liu Fong became known for avoiding ______ designs in her buildings. Instead of using standard shapes and colors, she typically explored innovative forms and daring hues. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. creative",
    optionB: "B. bold",
    optionC: "C. traditional",
    optionD: "D. understandable",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Helen Liu Fong’s architectural designs. In this context, “traditional” means conventional. The text states that rather than use “standard shapes and colors,” Fong pursued “innovative” and “daring” design choices in her work. Fong’s style is depicted as inventive, so it therefore makes sense in this context that she avoided mainstream, traditional designs in her buildings. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong’s work is innovative and experimental. Thus, Fong’s design choices could reasonably be considered creative, or original. She likely would have pursued creative designs, not avoided them. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong used “daring” hues in her designs. Thus, Fong likely would have pursued bold, or brave and vivid design choices; she wouldn’t have avoided them. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t address whether Fong’s designs are understandable, or reasonable or expected. The text focuses on certain characteristics of Fong’s designs, not on how people received or understood them.",

However, some scholars have suggested that the ancient Mesopotamian poem Epic of Gilgamesh may have had a far greater impact on Banisadr’s work. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. substantial",
    optionB: "B. satisfying",
    optionC: "C. unimportant",
    optionD: "D. appropriate",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the sentence about the inuences on Banisadr’s work. In context, “It is by no means” followed by “unimportant” conveys how it is relevant to recognize Bosch’s inuence on Banisadr. The text points out that the artist himself cites Bosch as an inspiration, and then goes on to claim that The Epic of Gilgamesh has had a more signicant inuence than Bosch. Choice A is incorrect because “substantial,” which means weighty or meaningful, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn’t be meaningful to acknowledge Bosch’s inuence on Banisadr. The phrase “indeed, Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration” doesn’t support this suggestion. Choice B is incorrect because “satisfying,” which means pleasing, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn’t be pleasing to acknowledge Bosch’s inuence on Banisadr. The phrase “indeed, Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration” doesn’t support this suggestion. Choice D is incorrect because “appropriate,” which means suitable, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn’t be proper to acknowledge Bosch’s inuence on Banisadr. The phrase “indeed, Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration” doesn’t support this suggestion.",

    optionD:
      "D. It elaborates on an aspect of the maple trees that the women evaluate.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text’s overall portrayal of how the women in Ohiyesa’s tribe harvested maple syrup. The text states that the women used an axe to strike the maple trees in order to nd out which ones would produce sap. The underlined sentence compares the trees to people, with the sap described as the trees’ “life-blood.” Some of the trees are ready to give out their sap, while others are unwilling to do so. Using personication, the sentence provides greater detail about the aspect of the maple trees—their potential to give sap—that the women are evaluating. Choice A is incorrect because the personalities of the women are not discussed in the text. Although the underlined sentence does mention “individual characters,” this reference is not to the women in the text but rather to the maple trees, which the sentence compares to people with individual character traits. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence focuses on the trees’ willingness or refusal to yield sap, not on the benecial relationship between the women and the trees. Additionally, although the text does suggest that the women and their tribe benet from the maple trees since the trees allow the women to harvest syrup, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the trees benet from this relationship in turn. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence is comparing maple trees to humans, not addressing the inuence of the natural environment on how the actual humans in the text, the women, behave.",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. examples of",
    optionB: "B. concerns about",
    optionC: "C. indications of",
    optionD: "D. similarities with",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because in context, sharing "similarities with" means having some resemblance to. The text establishes a comparison between two groups of mammals, stating that although they aren’t closely related, hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs play similar roles in their habitats, a circumstance that has resulted in the independent development of some of the same physical traits. This context supports the idea that hedgehog tenrecs resemble, or share basic similarities with, true hedgehogs in some respects. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that hedgehog tenrecs are "examples of," or representative of, true hedgehogs. The text states that despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren’t closely related; therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can’t be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "concerns about" would mean worries about or interests in. The text focuses on the various physical traits that hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs share. There’s nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs, or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "indications of" would mean evidence of. By listing a set of traits that hedgehog tenrecs share with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the two groups of mammals, and saying that the traits shared within one group of mammals provide evidence of another group of mammals wouldn’t be an effective way to establish the similarities between the two groups.',

    question:
      "Text 1 In 2021, a team led by Amir Siraj hypothesized that the Chicxulub impactor—the object that struck the Yucatán Peninsula sixty-six million years ago, precipitating the mass extinction of the dinosaurs—was likely a member of the class of long-period comets. As evidence, Siraj cited the carbonaceous chondritic composition of samples from the Chicxulub impact crater as well as of samples obtained from long-period comet Wild 2 in 2006. Text 2 Although long-period comets contain carbonaceous chondrites, asteroids are similarly rich in these materials. Furthermore, some asteroids are rich in iridium, as Natalia Artemieva points out, whereas long-period comets are not. Given the prevalence of iridium at the crater and, more broadly, in geological layers deposited worldwide following the impact, Artemieva argues that an asteroid is a more plausible candidate for the Chicxulub impactor. Based on the texts, how would Artemieva likely respond to Siraj’s hypothesis, as presented in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By insisting that it overestimates how representative Wild 2 is of long-period comets as a class",
    optionB:
      "B. By arguing that it does not account for the amount of iridium found in geological layers dating to the Chicxulub impact",
    optionC:
      "C. By praising it for connecting the composition of Chicxulub crater samples to the composition of certain asteroids",
    optionD:
      "D. By concurring that carbonaceous chondrites are prevalent in soil samples from sites distant from the Chicxulub crater",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. Siraj’s hypothesis is that the Chicxulub impactor was a long-period comet. But Artemieva points to the iridium found in the crater and in “geological layers that were deposited worldwide after the impact” as evidence that it was actually an asteroid, not a long-period comet. Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj’s hypothesis. Text 2 never discusses whether Wild 2 is representative of longperiod comets in general. Rather, Text 2 presents Artemieva’s argument that the Chicxulub impactor was an asteroid, not a long-term comet. Choice C is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj’s hypothesis. Siraj’s hypothesis doesn’t make this connection: rather, Siraj hypothesizes that the Chicxulub impactor was a long-term comet. Choice D is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj’s hypothesis. “Soil samples from sites distant from the Chicxulub crater” is too vague. Only soil samples from sites that are connected to the impact in some way are involved in either hypothesis.",

    optionA: "A. defunct",
    optionB: "B. arcane",
    optionC: "C. ubiquitous",
    optionD: "D. extraneous",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of artworks that were produced for exhibition on the internet. In this context, "defunct" means no longer existing or functioning. According to the text, many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible due to their reliance on certain software. As an example, the text cites Sinae Kim’s Genesis, which relied on software that was discontinued in 2021. This context supports the idea that the software is defunct. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that viewing artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet requires the use of software. Artists generally want their works to be seen by many people, so it wouldn’t make sense for creators of internet art to require the use of software that is "arcane," or known or knowable to only a few people. Moreover, the text states that a prominent example of software used to view these artworks is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it’s now defunct. Choice C is incorrect because "ubiquitous" would mean found everywhere, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text indicates that the reason why many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible has to do with the software required for viewing them. According to the text, one example of such software is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it’s now defunct. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the software used to view artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet is "extraneous," or irrelevant. Instead, the text indicates that use of specic software is required to view certain artworks from this period and that the discontinuation of the software renders the works inaccessible.',

    optionA: "A. insensible to",
    optionB: "B. manifest in",
    optionC: "C. scrutinized by",
    optionD: "D. complicated by",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Kelmscott Press’s books. In this context, "manifest in" means evident or apparent from. The text states that the Kelmscott Press, which was cofounded by William Morris, produced its books using preindustrial methods. The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the creation of medieval manuscripts. This context suggests that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is apparent from, or manifest in, the methods and materials his company employed. Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is "insensible to," or unaware of or lacking perception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the production of the Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used to produce the Kelmscott editions are evidence of Morris’s repudiation of industrialization. Choice C is incorrect because it would not make sense to say that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization was "scrutinized by," or examined closely by, the Kelmscott editions’ use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation. Although creating the Kelmscott editions may have involved examining the books closely, the text does not mention this aspect of Morris’s work, and in any case, the action of using certain materials to create those editions cannot scrutinize Morris’s attitude toward industrialization. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is "complicated by," or made more complex or dicult by, the Kelmscott Press’s use of preindustrial methods and handcrafted elements to produce books.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. interjected",
    optionB: "B. committed",
    optionC: "C. illustrated",
    optionD: "D. prescribed",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of gender roles in Shakespeare’s comedies. As used in this context, “prescribed” would mean laid down as rules. The text indicates that the characters in the comedies often defy gender roles that are “socially dictated” (even if most characters do return to those roles eventually) and that scholars have been very interested in these acts of deance. This context indicates that what the characters are rebelling against are standards of behavior prescribed by the society of the time. Choice A is incorrect because saying that expectations about gender were “interjected,” or suddenly inserted between other things, wouldn’t make sense in context. There’s no suggestion in the text that the issue of gender roles was inserted between other things or was an interruption in a larger discussion. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been “socially dictated,” not expectations that society has “committed,” or carried out, entrusted, or promised. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been “socially dictated,” not expectations that have been “illustrated,” or claried with examples. Although it’s possible for expectations about gender roles to be illustrated, there’s nothing in the text to indicate that characters in Shakespeare’s comedies rebel against illustrations of gender expectations.",

      "Text 1 Philosopher G.E. Moore’s most inuential work entails the concept of common sense. He asserts that there are certain beliefs that all people, including philosophers, know instinctively to be true, whether or not they profess otherwise: among them, that they have bodies, or that they exist in a world with other objects that have three dimensions. Moore’s careful work on common sense may seem obvious but was in fact groundbreaking. Text 2 External world skepticism is a philosophical stance supposing that we cannot be sure of the existence of anything outside our own minds. During a lecture, G.E. Moore once offered a proof refuting this stance by holding out his hands and saying, “Here is one hand, and here is another.” Many philosophers reexively reject this proof (Annalisa Coliva called it “an obviously annoying failure”) but have found it a challenge to articulate exactly why the proof fails. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to proponents of the philosophical stance outlined in Text 2?",
    optionA:
      "A. By agreeing with those proponents that Moore’s treatment of positions that contradict his own is fundamentally unserious",
    optionB:
      "B. By suggesting that an instinctive distaste for Moore’s position is preventing external world skeptics from constructing a suciently rigorous refutation of Moore",

    optionD:
      "D. By pointing out that Moore would assert that external world skepticism is at odds with other beliefs those proponents must unavoidably hold",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. According to the author of Text 1, Moore’s denition of common sense—things we instinctively know are true—includes the belief that we all “exist in a world with other objects.” The author of Text 1 describes this notion as both “obvious” and “groundbreaking.” So it’s safe to infer that the author would observe that Moore would respond to external world skeptics by arguing that since everyone instinctively knows that things exist outside of their own minds, then external world skepticism must be wrong. Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to external world skeptics. If anything, the author of Text 1 seems to agree with Moore. Choice B is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to external world skeptics. The author of Text 1 never mentions external world skeptics directly, let alone why they have a hard time refuting Moore’s position. Choice C is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to external world skeptics.

    optionC: "C. judges",
    optionD: "D. neglects",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Sueño de Familia art exhibition. In this context, “spans” means extends across or covers. The text states that the exhibition explores González’s artistic heritage and features artwork by her great-grandfather, grandmother, mother, and niece. This context conveys the idea that the exhibition spans, or extends across, ve generations of González’s family.

The text indicates that the exhibition features artwork by family members from ve generations, not that the ve generations themselves have been acquired for inclusion in the exhibition. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the purpose of the exhibition is to highlight artwork, not to “judge,” or give an opinion on, ve generations of the artist’s family.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The text presents the speaker’s experience of viewing the sea. In the underlined portion, the speaker focuses on the idea that the waves hitting rocks on the shore are a relentless and enduring force: they are constantly pushed back (“ever repulsed”) but always return (“ever rushing on”), as though they have an energy that can’t be overcome (“a life that will not know defeat”). Choice A is incorrect. Although the underlined portion characterizes the waves as a relentless force (always “repulsed” but still “rushing on” and never being defeated), the speaker doesn’t suggest that the surroundings are intimidating. Instead, the speaker presents the scene in a positive way, describing the “deep delight” of the “gladsome,” or cheerful, waves and feeling “the heart / Leap joyous” while viewing the sea. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t suggest that the speaker is ambivalent, or has mixed feelings about, the natural world. Instead, it presents a single view of one part of the immediate surroundings: the speaker characterizes the sea’s waves as an unstoppable force, since they are constantly pushed back but always return (“ever repulsed, yet ever rushing on”). Choice D is incorrect. Although the text later suggests the speaker’s view of her own thoughts by referring to a “clouded brain” and a heart that leaps joyously, this reference neither occurs within the underlined portion nor establishes a clear contrast with the relentless determination of the waves.

      "Text 1 Like the work of Ralph Ellison before her, Toni Morrison’s novels feature scenes in which characters deliver sermons of such length and verbal dexterity that for a time, the text exchanges the formal parameters of ction for those of oral literature. Given the many other echoes of Ellison in Morrison’s novels, both in structure and prose style, these scenes suggest Ellison’s direct inuence on Morrison. Text 2 In their destabilizing effect on literary form, the sermons in Morrison’s works recall those in Ellison’s. Yet literature by Black Americans abounds in moments where interpolated speech erodes the division between oral and written forms that literature in English has traditionally observed. Morrison’s use of the sermon is attributable not only to the inuence of Ellison but also to a community-wide strategy of resistance to externally imposed literary conventions. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize the underlined claim in Text 1?",

Ellison, Text 2 alleges, is only one of many inuences on Morrison. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text specically mentions sermons in works by authors other than Morrison or Ellison, only a tendency towards eroding “the division between oral and written forms” among Black American writers. Choice C is incorrect. Both texts describe similarities between the works of Ellison and Morrison, and neither points out instances of divergence.

The text indicates that although US trac signals have lights of three different colors (red, yellow, and green), this wasn’t the case until the 1920s, when the three-light signal was rst developed. Before then, the text suggests, trac signals had fewer lights (as indicated by the word “only” in the second sentence). This context supports the idea that before the 1920s, trac signals featured only red and green lights. Choice A is incorrect because “avoided” means kept away from someone or something or prevented something from occurring, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn’t discuss keeping away from someone or something but instead focuses on what US trac signals look like. The text states that they didn’t have lights of three different colors until the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Choice C is incorrect because “appreciated” means admired or increased in value, neither of which would make sense in context. The text focuses solely on the fact that US trac signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. The text doesn’t mention how this characteristic or trac signals in general are perceived or what their value is. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes “trac signals,” which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to admire or increase the value of something. Choice D is incorrect because “disregarded” means ignored or treated something as unworthy of notice, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn’t discuss how people react to trac signals; rather, it addresses the idea that US trac signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes “trac signals,” which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to ignore or treat something in a particular manner.",

      "The following text is adapted from Charles Chesnutt’s 1899 short story “Mars Jeems’s Nightmare.” The narrator and his wife have recently moved to the southern United States, and Julius is their carriage driver. Julius [was] very useful when we moved to our new residence. He had a thorough knowledge of the neighborhood, was familiar with the roads and the watercourses, knew the qualities of the various soils and what they would produce, and where the best hunting and shing were to be had. He was a marvelous hand in the management of horses and dogs. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To compare the narrator’s reaction to a new home with his wife’s reaction",
    optionB: "B. To give an example of Julius’s knowledge about soil",
    optionC:
      "C. To show that the narrator and Julius often hunt and sh together",
    optionD: "D. To explain different ways in which Julius was helpful",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain different ways in which Julius was helpful. The text begins with the narrator stating that Julius was very helpful to him and his wife when they moved to their new residence. The narrator then provides a list of examples to illustrate Julius’s helpfulness. For instance, the narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood’s roads, which suggests that he was helpful in navigating them, and that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs. The text’s many examples of Julius’s usefulness reinforce just how helpful he was and in how many different ways. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray either the narrator’s or his wife’s reaction to their new home. Rather, the text focuses on how Julius was useful to the narrator and his wife in their new home. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Julius was knowledgeable about the soil, this is one of several supporting details that illustrate how helpful Julius was. Moreover, the text merely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn’t provide an example of that knowledge. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest the frequency with which the narrator and Julius hunted and shed together. In fact, it’s unclear from the text whether the narrator and Julius hunted and shed together at all. The text merely indicates that Julius knew the best places to hunt and sh—a detail that supports the text’s main purpose by conveying Julius’s usefulness.",

    question:
      "Text 1 Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel Orlando is an oddity within her body of work. Her other major novels consist mainly of scenes of everyday life and describe their characters’ interior states in great detail, whereas Orlando propels itself through a series of fantastical events and considers its characters’ psychology more supercially. Woolf herself sometimes regarded the novel as a minor work, even admitting once that she “began it as a joke.” Text 2 Like Woolf’s other great novels, Orlando portrays how people’s memories inform their experience of the present. Like those works, it examines how people navigate social interactions shaped by gender and social class. Though it is lighter in tone—more entertaining, even—this literary “joke” nonetheless engages seriously with the themes that motivated the four or ve other novels by Woolf that have achieved the status of literary classics. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assessment of Orlando presented in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By conceding that Woolf’s talents were best suited to serious novels but asserting that the humor in Orlando is often effective",
    optionB:
      "B. By agreeing that Orlando is less impressive than certain other novels by Woolf but arguing that it should still be regarded as a classic",
    optionC:
      "C. By acknowledging that Orlando clearly differs from Woolf’s other major novels but insisting on its centrality to her body of work nonetheless",
    optionD:
      "D. By concurring that the reputation of Orlando as a minor work has led readers to overlook this novel but maintaining that the reputation is unearned",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the assessment of Orlando in Text 1. Both authors agree that Orlando is unusual for Woolf: Text 1 states that the novel examines its characters’ psychologies more supercially than Woolf’s other novels do, and Text 2 describes it as being lighter in tone. However, while Text 1 calls Orlando an “oddity” and mentions that Woolf “began it as a joke,” Text 2 asserts that Orlando engages the same themes as Woolf’s other great novels. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely accept that Orlando differs from Woolf’s other novels but would also insist on its importance in the context of Woolf’s work as a writer. Choice A is incorrect. Text 2 does suggest that the humor in Orlando is effective. However, there’s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author would agree that Woolf’s talents were best suited to serious novels. Rather, the author of Text 2 compares Orlando favorably to other novels by Woolf that are implied to be darker in tone. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 does not indicate that Orlando is less impressive than Woolf’s other novels, but instead points out that it engages the same themes as other novels by Woolf that are considered classics. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in Text 1 or Text 2 to suggest that readers have generally ignored Orlando because of its reputation.",

Roman Rakov and Kedron Silsbee shed light on the subject when they used modeling to determine a complex set of factors that could support planets’ development. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. a discernible",
    optionB: "B. a straightforward",
    optionC: "C. an inconclusive",
    optionD: "D. an unbiased",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s description of efforts to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems. As used in this context, describing an explanation as “a straightforward” one would mean that the explanation is direct and uncomplicated. The text asserts that since it should be “nearly impossible” for planets to form in binary star systems, it’s “not surprising” that there isn’t a straightforward explanation for the existence of planets in such systems; the fact that one potential approach involves “complex” factors offers further contextual support for this idea. Choice A is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that there isn’t “a discernible” explanation—meaning an explanation capable of being perceived—for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text discusses just such an explanation offered by Roman Rakov and Kedron Silsbee, which indicates that their explanation can be discerned. Choice C is incorrect because the text emphasizes how dicult it is to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems, suggesting that the situation isn’t marked by the lack of “an inconclusive” explanation—an explanation that does not resolve the issue—but rather that if any explanations have been offered, they’ve likely been inconclusive ones. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a lack of “an unbiased,” or impartial and unprejudiced, explanation for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text indicates that it’s dicult to explain the existence of planets in such systems and it describes one attempt to do so, but there is no evidence that explanations from Roman Rakov and Kedron Silsbee or others are biased.",

    optionB: "B. vigilance",
    optionC: "C. interest",
    optionD: "D. consensus",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of US forest land classications. In this context, "consensus" means agreement. The text indicates that a percentage given in a US forest land report differs from other estimates and that this discrepancy isn’t surprising, given that forest researchers regularly dispute one another’s classications of parts of US forest land as either mature or old growth. This context conveys that there is little agreement when it comes to these categories. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classications of US forest land as either mature or old growth, which directly indicates that when it comes to these categories, there is much "deliberation," or discussion and consideration, not little deliberation. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classications of US forest land as either mature or old growth; this doesn’t imply that there is little "vigilance," or careful attention, among researchers when it comes to these categories but rather conveys that researchers do pay attention to forest land classications and question one another’s decisions. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classications of US forest land as either mature or old growth; this doesn’t imply that there is little "interest," or concern, among researchers when it comes to these categories but rather conveys that researchers are concerned with forest land classications and pay attention to one another’s classications.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the art installation Anthem. In this context, “inventive” means characterized by invention and creativity. The text explains that critics’ responses to the installation involved praise for Tsang’s creative transformation of a space into a dynamic exhibit with huge images and lots of sound. This context conveys that the critics found the piece particularly creative. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that critics praised the installation for being dynamic and including huge images and lots of sound, and it wouldn’t make sense to describe such an exhibit as “restrained,” or limited and not extravagant or showy. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that critics found the installation “inexplicable,” or incapable of being explained or interpreted, since the critics were able to explain their praise for the installation’s transformation of a space with huge images and lots of sound.

      "Text 1 Most animals can regenerate some parts of their bodies, such as skin. But when a three-banded panther worm is cut into three pieces, each piece grows into a new worm. Researchers are investigating this feat partly to learn more about humans’ comparatively limited abilities to regenerate, and they’re making exciting progress. An especially promising discovery is that both humans and panther worms have a gene for early growth response (EGR) linked to regeneration. Text 2 When Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR, it caused excitement. However, as the team pointed out, the gene likely functions very differently in humans than it does in panther worms. Srivastava has likened EGR to a switch that activates other genes involved in regeneration in panther worms, but how this switch operates in humans remains unclear. Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 2 most likely say about Text 1’s characterization of the discovery involving EGR?",
    optionA:
      "A. It is reasonable given that Srivastava and her team have identied how EGR functions in both humans and panther worms.",
    optionB:
      "B. It is overly optimistic given additional observations from Srivastava and her team.",
    optionC:
      "C. It is unexpected given that Srivastava and her team’s ndings were generally met with enthusiasm.",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Text 1 based on the information provided. Text 1 discusses the discovery of a regeneration-linked gene, EGR, in both three-banded panther worms (which are capable of full regeneration) and humans (who have relatively limited regeneration abilities). Text 1 characterizes this discovery as “especially promising” and a sign of “exciting progress” in understanding human regeneration. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR nding pointed out that while EGR’s function in humans isn’t yet known, it’s likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1’s enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava’s team’s observations about EGR in humans. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven’t yet identied how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn’t say that Text 1’s excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1’s excitement as premature and overly optimistic. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 does treat Srivastava’s team’s ndings with enthusiasm; it describes the discovery of EGR in both three-banded panther worms and humans as promising and exciting. It would be illogical for the author of Text 2 to say that because most others treat the discovery with enthusiasm, Text 1’s enthusiastic characterization of the discovery is unexpected. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 isn’t at all dismissive of Srivastava’s team’s ndings; instead, Text 1 is optimistic about the EGR discovery, characterizing it as promising and exciting. There’s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author of Text 2 would say that Text 1’s praise for the discovery is dismissive, or disdainful.",

      "Several studies have found negligible electoral consequences for governments that impose scal austerity measures, yet some European governments recently suffered electorally due to their austerity programs. Evelyne Huebscher and colleagues attribute this incongruity to governments’ tendency—not followed in the recent European cases—to implement austerity programs strategically to avoid electoral costs (e.g., setting spending cuts to take effect only after the next election), which has obscured the inherent political risks of austerity measures in the election data scholars have examined.

    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The underlined sentence explains that contrary to what several studies would suggest, recent European governments suffered electorally after the launch of scal austerity programs. The text goes on to indicate that the researchers generated their ndings from data that didn’t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures because the data were based on cases in which governments had set austerity programs to take effect after the next election, a practice the European governments that recently suffered electorally didn’t adhere to, thus introducing a complicating factor resulting in a conict between the research ndings and recent events. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t indicate that the discrepancy described in the text is between observations made in study settings and observations made in real-world settings. Rather, the underlined sentence indicates that the outcome of recent events is contrary to what would be expected based on the ndings of several studies. Additionally, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the studies mentioned did not use real-world data; instead, the text indicates that the data used was generated under potentially different circumstances than the recent events. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t present a long-standing divergence in research ndings but rather a discrepancy between past research ndings and recent events that the text goes on to attribute to researchers’ use of data that didn’t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures. Choice D is incorrect because while the underlined sentence notes that there have been some recent exceptions to a general pattern observed in several research studies, it does not go on to attribute this exception to the researchers underestimating inconsistencies in the data.

But El Paso surpassed all other cities in the state. This city produced twenty-two newspapers in Spanish during that period. El Paso is located on the border with Mexico and has always had a large population of Spanish speakers.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text.

The text then goes on to note that in El Paso, there were twenty-two newspapers published in Spanish in the late 1800s, more than any other Texas city. The text then concludes by explaining that the reason for this large number of Spanish-language newspapers was likely El Paso’s location near Mexico and its large population of Spanish speakers.

      "Text 1 Because literacy in Nahuatl script, the writing system of the Aztec Empire, was lost after Spain invaded central Mexico in the 1500s, it is unclear exactly how meaning was encoded in the script’s symbols. Although many scholars had assumed that the symbols signied entire words, linguist Alfonso Lacadena theorized in 2008 that they signied units of language smaller than words: individual syllables. Text 2 The growing consensus among scholars of Nahuatl script is that many of its symbols could signify either words or syllables, depending on syntax and content at any given site within a text. For example, the symbol signifying the word huipil (blouse) in some contexts could signify the syllable “pil” in others, as in the place name “Chipiltepec.” Thus, for the Aztecs, reading required a determination of how such symbols functioned each time they appeared in a text. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize Lacadena’s theory, as described in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By praising the theory for recognizing that the script’s symbols could represent entire words",
    optionB:

    optionD:
      "D. By cautioning that the theory overlooks certain important aspects of how the script functioned",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. Lacadena’s theory is that Nahuatl script symbols signied syllables, but the consensus described in Text 2 is that they can signify either symbols or full words, depending on the context. So the author of Text 2 would likely consider Lacadena’s theory too simplistic: it’s missing the importance of the context in determining the meaning of a symbol. Choice A is incorrect.

And as Jane X. Luu et al. point out, the singular nature of impact ejection makes it untenable as an account of multiple loss episodes of similar duration over several years. Instead, Luu et al. are likely correct that 6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",

    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by introducing the natural phenomenon of intermittent mass loss with regard to Asteroid 6478 Gault and notes that it curiously has not lost mass at its perihelion like other asteroids typically do. The text then refutes "solar energy–driven ice vaporization" and "the singular nature of impact ejection" as two possible explanations for Asteroid 6478 Gault’s intermittent mass loss. Finally, the text presents Luu et al.’s explanation that "6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability," which the author says is "likely correct." Thus, the overall structure of the text is that it introduces a natural phenomenon, refutes two potential explanations for that phenomenon, and then presents a third explanation for that phenomenon that the author regards as plausible. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t distinguish between multiple observations. It focuses on the single observation that Asteroid 6478 Gault is losing mass and evaluates multiple explanations for the phenomenon. The text also asserts that Luu et al.’s explanation is credible and "likely correct." Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a natural phenomenon, not a specic astronomical nding. In addition, although the text does note awed reasons for Asteroid 6478 Gault’s intermittent mass loss, it doesn’t mention that Asteroid 6478 Gault’s intermittent mass loss is based on new evidence. Choice D is incorrect.

A "hypothesis" is "a theory about something," but no theories are provided about elkhorn coral in this text, just facts. Choice B is incorrect. "Anity" represents "an inclination or liking toward something." As genetic mutations tend to occur without any conscious effort, you can’t really have an inclination toward passing on somatic mutations. Choice D is incorrect. "Corroboration" means "evidence to support or prove something." Because elkhorn coral do the opposite of what most animals do, they do not provide corroboration of the theory that somatic mutations can’t be passed onto offspring. Rather, they show the opposite.',

      "Scientists previously thought that all electric eels belong to a single species, but a team of researchers led by zoologist C. David de Santana proved this idea wrong by ______ that there are in fact three distinct species of electric eels. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. pretending",
    optionB: "B. complaining",
    optionC: "C. requiring",
    optionD: "D. demonstrating",

    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. “Demonstrating” means “showing,” and the text describes how de Santana disproved a previous belief in only one species of electric eel by showing that three electric eel species actually exist. Choice A is incorrect. Pretending that there are three species of electric eel might be a fun game for marine biologists, but it wouldn’t prove the existence of more than one species. Choice B is incorrect. Complaining won’t prove anything about eels, so de Santana could not have proved wrong the idea of only one species of electric eel by complaining about it.

    optionA: "A. secretive",
    optionB: "B. ecient",
    optionC: "C. outgoing",
    optionD: "D. unsympathetic",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about Kouchaki and colleagues’ research into how workload affects productivity. In context, “ecient” means effective or well organized. The text indicates that, according to Kouchaki and colleagues’ research, people who worked on hard tasks rst were “more skilled and productive” than those who did easy tasks rst. This context conveys the idea that despite their sense of accomplishment, the people who chose to do the easy tasks rst were less ecient or productive than those who tackled hard tasks rst. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that workers who do easy tasks rst are less “secretive,” or uncommunicative or silent, than those who do hard tasks rst. Rather, the text suggests that people are less skillful or ecient if they tackle easy tasks before the hard ones. Choice C is incorrect because “outgoing” means openly friendly, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text focuses on Kouchaki and colleagues’ research in which people who worked on hard tasks rst were “more skilled and productive” than those who did easy tasks rst and were therefore less ecient. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that workers who do easy tasks rst are less “unsympathetic,” or insensitive or unkind, than those who do hard tasks rst.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. decisive",
    optionB: "B. lacking",
    optionC: "C. variable",
    optionD: "D. dormant",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion about genes related to hibernation. In this context, “dormant” means inactive. The text explains that the same genes that enable certain nonhuman mammal species to hibernate during the winter by altering their bodily processes are also found in our species but have “essentially no effect” on humans’ bodily processes. In other words, these genes don’t function in humans. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “decisive” means has the power to affect the outcome of something, but the text states that genes related to hibernation are instead inactive in humans—that is, the genes don’t affect humans’ bodily processes, although they are present in their bodies. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “lacking” means missing, but the text states that the genes are present in humans, though inactive. Choice C is incorrect because “variable” means characterized by the potential to change, but the text indicates that these genes don’t change in their effect on humans’ bodily processes; instead, the genes are consistently inactive in humans.",

    optionC: "C. warned",
    optionD: "D. depended on",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Arturo A. Schomburg’s collection. In this context, the phrase “depended on” means relied on. The text explains that Schomburg, wanting to preserve “books, art, and other materials” created by peoples of African descent from around the world, built a large collection of these objects. The text also states that in order to obtain these items, Schomburg asked friends and colleagues who were traveling internationally to bring them back for him. This implies that he wouldn’t have been able to create his collection without help. Thus, the context supports the idea that Schomburg relied on, or depended on, friends and colleagues to build his collection. Choice A is incorrect because “admired” means respected and approved of. Although it’s reasonable to expect that Schomburg respected his friends and colleagues, the text doesn’t discuss any such aspect of their relationships. The text focuses instead on what Schomburg asked his friends and colleagues to do to help build his collection. Choice B is incorrect because “disagreed with” means held an opposing belief, and nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg and his friends or colleagues held opposing views on any subject. In fact, the text strongly implies that Schomburg’s friends and colleagues supported him in his goal of preserving objects of importance for Black history and culture by bringing him such objects from around the world. Choice C is incorrect because “warned” means informed someone in advance about something dangerous, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. Nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg thought his friends and colleagues were in any danger, let alone that he warned them of danger.",

      "Text 1 When companies in the same industry propose merging with one another, they often claim that the merger will benet consumers by increasing eciency and therefore lowering prices. Economist Ying Fan investigated this notion in the context of the United States newspaper market. She modeled a hypothetical merger of Minneapolis-area newspapers and found that subscription prices would rise following a merger. Text 2 Economists Dario Focarelli and Fabio Panetta have argued that research on the effect of mergers on prices has focused excessively on short-term effects, which tend to be adverse for consumers. Using the case of consumer banking in Italy, they show that over the long term (several years, in their study), the eciency gains realized by merged companies do result in economic benets for consumers. Based on the texts, how would Focarelli and Panetta (Text 2) most likely respond to Fan’s ndings (Text 1)?",
    optionA:
      "A. They would recommend that Fan compare the near-term effect of a merger on subscription prices in the Minneapolis area with the effect of a merger in another\nnewspaper market.",
    optionB:
      "B. They would argue that over the long term the expenses incurred by the merged newspaper company will also increase.",
    optionC:
      "C. They would encourage Fan to investigate whether the projected effect on subscription prices persists over an extended perio",
    optionD:
      "D. They would claim that mergers have a different effect on consumer prices in the newspaper industry than in most other industries.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because, based on the information presented in the texts, it represents how Focarelli and Panetta would most likely respond to Fan’s ndings. Text 1 indicates that Fan found that a newspaper merger would result in a rise in subscription prices. This rise wouldn’t benet customers, who would have to pay more for news after a merger. Text 2 presents Focarelli and Panetta’s argument that merger research tends to focus too much on what happens immediately after the merger. Text 2 goes on to describe their nding that mergers can be economically benecial for consumers over the long term. This suggests that Focarelli and Panetta would encourage Fan to investigate the long-term effect of the hypothetical newspaper merger on subscription prices. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t indicate that Focarelli and Panetta connect the effects of mergers to specic locations. Instead, Focarelli and Panetta focus on the length of time over which the effects of mergers should be evaluated. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that Focarelli and Panetta found that merged companies experience "eciency gains" over the long term, meaning that their expenses go down relative to their output, not that their expenses increase. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no indication in Text 2 that Focarelli and Panetta believe that the newspaper industry is different from any other industry when it comes to the effects of mergers. Although their own research was about consumer banking, Text 2 suggests that they view their conclusions as applicable to mergers in general.',

      "When ancient oak planks were unearthed during subway construction in Rome, Mauro Bernabei and his team examined the growth rings in the wood to determine where these planks came from. By comparing the growth rings on the planks to records of similar rings in oaks from Europe, the team could trace the wood to the Jura region of France, hundreds of kilometers from Rome. Because timber could only have been transported from distant Jura to Rome by boat, the team’s ndings suggest the complexity of Roman trade routes.

    optionC:
      "C. It explains why the planks were made from oak rather than a different kind of woo",
    optionD:
      "D. It describes common methods used in Roman subway construction.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence explains that Bernabei and his team studied growth rings to obtain information about the ancient oak planks found during a construction project in Rome. The next sentence presents what the researchers learned: the wood from the planks came from France’s Jura region, which is far from Rome. The underlined sentence then presents the implications of the ndings about the planks: the wood must have been brought to Rome by boat, a dicult task that suggests Roman trade routes were complex. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to present a conclusion about Roman trade routes based on the team’s ndings. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the team thought the ancient planks were used in the construction of a boat, nor does the underlined sentence question that conclusion. Instead, the text states that the wood could only have been transported from Jura to Rome in a boat. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence simply offers a conclusion drawn from the team’s ndings about the likely place of origin of the ancient planks; the text never mentions why oak was chosen for the planks instead of other wood. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole addresses any methods that Romans used in constructing subways.

    question:
      "Text 1 Literary scholars have struggled with the vastness of Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka’s collective works of drama (spanning over 20 plays in total). It is best, however, to understand Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist chronologically. Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, with each one representing a particular thematic and stylistic cohesion: the 1960s, the two decades between 1970 and 1990, and lastly, from roughly 1990 onwards. Text 2 It is tempting to impose a linear sense of order on the expanse of Wole Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist. However, critics who have considered Soyinka’s plays to t neatly into three phases overlook potential commonalities in Soyinka’s work that span across these phases. Additionally, this view may discount signicant differences in the styles and content of plays written around the same time. Which choice best describes a difference in how the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 view the study of Soyinka’s works of drama?",
    optionA:
      "A. While the author of Text 1 believes that thinking about Soyinka’s works of theater in phases is useful, the author of Text 2 views such an approach as limiting.",
    optionB:

    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. The author of Text 1 states that Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, implying that this is a helpful way to understand his works. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, challenges this view and says that it overlooks potential commonalities and differences in Soyinka’s work across what Text 1 calls distinctive stylistic phases. Choice B is incorrect. This choice overstates the central claim of Text 2. The author of Text 2 argues against the chronological progression supported in Text 1, but does not go so far as to say that Soyinka’s style remained consistent. In fact, Text 2 points out “signicant differences in styles and content” among Soyinka’s plays. Choice C is incorrect. Neither of the texts mention Soyinka’s poetry, nor do they rank his dramatic writing relative to his other work. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text discusses the political aspects of Soyinka’s plays, nor do they make any claims about whether they have changed over time.",

    optionB: "B. expansions",
    optionC: "C. reforms",
    optionD: "D. possessions",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the early British postal system. In this context, "reforms" most nearly means attempts at improving something. The text indicates that the pay-upon-delivery postage method led to fee avoidance on the part of recipients. It then says that action was taken to improve the postal system, giving examples such as the move to having the sender pay and axing stamps to indicate payment had been received. These represent revisions to the system intended to improve its functioning; therefore, "reforms" most logically completes the text. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "investigations" most nearly means attempts to understand something. And although it is plausible that an attempt to improve the postal system would involve investigations, nothing in the text provides a logical basis for understanding the example of changes like axing stamps to letters as an investigation. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, "expansions" most nearly means additions to something. Although the text indicates that some new policies were adopted, nothing in the text suggests that the overall number of policies increased, which expansions would seem to entail. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, "possessions" most nearly means items of personal property or things that otherwise belong to, or are part of, something.

The text indicates that Jung and her team found that seeing a helpful (or prosocial) act makes a bystander more likely to help someone else, which can in turn inspire additional people to help others. That is, the team showed that single acts of kindness can foster additional prosocial acts across a group. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Jung and her team found that single acts of kindness “require,” or depend on or make obligatory, broader prosocial (or helpful) behavior across a group. There’s no suggestion in the text that individual acts of kindness can only occur if other prosocial acts have already occurred, and the text indicates only that an act of kindness can inspire additional helpful acts, not that it necessarily will do so.

The text indicates that handedness is “easy to observe in humans,” but that animal-behavior researchers use special tasks to determine handedness in other animals. This context and the use of “less” before the blank indicate that compared with handedness in humans, handedness in other animals is less recognizable. Choice B is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less “intriguing,” or fascinating, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. involuntarily",
    optionB: "B. benecially",
    optionC: "C. strenuously",
    optionD: "D. smoothly",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of diaphragm contractions and hiccups. In this context, “involuntarily” means done without any control, or by reex. The text explains that when a person’s diaphragm repeatedly contracts and results in hiccups (which may be benecial for infants), those muscle contractions are “uncontrollable.” This context indicates that the diaphragm contractions occur without the person’s control. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t support the logical relationship established in the text’s discussion of diaphragm contractions and hiccups. The text indicates that although specic causes for hiccups haven’t been identied, it may be the case that the muscle contractions that occur have an important purpose in infants. It wouldn’t make sense to say that even though the contractions occur “benecially,” or with a good or helpful effect, they might play a positive role in infants’ breathing regulation. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups are “uncontrollable.” Because those muscle contractions are described as happening automatically and without the person’s control, it wouldn’t make sense to describe them as occurring “strenuously,” or in a way that requires great effort or energy. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the quality of the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups beyond stating that they are “uncontrollable.” Nothing in the text indicates that those muscle contractions occur “smoothly,” or evenly and continuously.",

    question:
      "Streams and rivers carry soil and rocks from one location to another. But there is another way for these geological materials to move. Scientists call this process “aeolian transport.” In aeolian transport, winds move small particles of soil or rock over potentially great distances. Geologist Melisa Diaz and her team studied dust in Antarctica to nd out if it was moved by aeolian transport. They discovered that the dust matched geological material in Australia. Aeolian transport had carried it from one continent to another, across thousands of miles of open ocean. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",
    optionA:
      "A. It presents Melisa Diaz’s remarks about diculties that her team encountere",
    optionB:
      "B. It introduces a scientic term that is used in the discussion that follows.",
    optionC:
      "C. It emphasizes the surprising nature of the ndings that are presente",
    optionD:
      "D. It explains the difference between two kinds of geological material.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The rst two sentences introduce the idea that soil and rocks can be moved from one location to another by something other than rivers and streams. The underlined sentence then states that the term used by scientists to refer to this process is “aeolian transport.” The discussion that follows explains what aeolian transport is (the movement of small geological materials over potentially great distances by the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust particles had been moved by aeolian transport from Australia to Antarctica. Thus, the underlined portion introduces a scientic term that is used in the discussion that follows. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text doesn’t present any remarks from Melisa Diaz, nor does it suggest that Diaz and her team encountered diculties in their study. Instead, the phrase in quotation marks in the underlined portion simply presents a term that is used by scientists to refer to a specic process discussed in the text. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in either the underlined portion or the text as a whole suggests that the ndings of the study presented in the text were surprising or unexpected. In fact, the text suggests that Diaz and her team wanted to see if aeolian transport could explain the appearance of certain geological materials in Antarctica, and their ndings did indeed conrm the involvement of aeolian transport. Choice D is incorrect. Although the rst sentence of the text mentions soil and rocks, which are two different kinds of geological material, the underlined portion doesn’t refer to these materials, nor does it explain the difference between them. Rather, the underlined portion introduces the scientic term “aeolian transport,” which is used in the discussion that follows.",

      "The Menominee and Anishinaabe peoples have been growing wild rice—known as manoomin in the Ojibwe language—in the Great Lakes region of North America for centuries, but climatic changes are causing lakes to get deeper, thereby threatening wild rice. These plants are extremely ______ to water depth during the “oating leaf” stage of development, and if the water is too deep, the buoyancy of the young wild-rice plants can literally uproot them from the lake bottom, destroying them. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. immune",
    optionB: "B. sensitive",
    optionC: "C. limited",
    optionD: "D. receptive",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of wild rice. As used in this context, "sensitive" means vulnerable or easily affected. The text indicates that climate change is causing the lakes to get deeper, which consequently threatens the wild rice that grows in the area. The text goes on to state that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to uproot from the bottom of the lake. This context supports the idea that the plants are sensitive to water depth during early stages of development. Choice A is incorrect because "immune" means protected or shielded, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text explains that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to become uprooted and destroyed, indicating that these plants are harmed by deep water, not protected from it. Choice C is incorrect because "limited" means conned or restrained, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text explains that water depth can negatively affect young wild-rice plants but doesn’t suggest that water depth limits or restrains the plants. Choice D is incorrect because "receptive" means open or tolerant, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text doesn’t indicate that the wild-rice plants are open to or tolerant of an increase in water depth but rather the opposite: an increase in water depth can harm young wild-rice plants.',

On cloudless nights after a daytime rain, Saeed’s father would sometimes bring out the telescope, and the family would sip green tea on their balcony, enjoying a breeze, and take turns to look up at objects whose light, often, had been emitted before any of these three viewers had been born—light from other centuries, only now reaching Earth. ©2017 by Mohsin Hamid As used in the text, what does the word “reaching” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Arriving at",
    optionB: "B. Consulting with",
    optionC: "C. Running to",
    optionD: "D. Clinging to",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. The word "reaching" in this text means "to arrive" at Earth. Before, the light had been traveling across space; now, it had arrived at Earth. Choice B is incorrect. "Consulting with" means "seeking advice or information from someone." Light is not alive, so it can’t consult with Earth. Choice C is incorrect. It’s confusing to say that starlight is "only now running to Earth," both because light doesn’t literally "run" and because the text is describing the moment the light touches Earth, not the period of time when it’s traveling to Earth. Choice D is incorrect. This might be tempting, as "clinging to" has a connotation of "sticking to." It wouldn’t make sense to say that the light was "only now" clinging to Earth.',

African languages also made important contributions to the Puerto Rican dialect. For example, the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in it can be ______ to how they are pronounced in Yoruba, a West African language. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. traced",
    optionB: "B. surrendered",
    optionC: "C. announced",
    optionD: "D. offered",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the origins of the unique dialect of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico. In this context, "traced" means tracked back to. The text notes that the regional variety of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has its roots in the language of the Taínos and in the West African language of Yoruba. This context supports the idea that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced back to Yoruba. Choice B is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be "surrendered," or handed over on demand, to the pronunciation in Yoruba. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish has been "announced," or ocially declared or proclaimed. According to the text, elements of the dialect have been inherited or borrowed from African languages, and the relationship between the pronunciation of certain vowels in the Puerto Rican dialect and in Yoruba is an example of this inheritance, suggesting that the pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced to Yoruba. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be "offered," or presented as a gift, to the pronunciation in Yoruba.',

    optionB: "B. ensured",
    optionC: "C. denied",
    optionD: "D. underestimated",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Nuttall’s 1886 research paper. In this context, “acknowledged” means recognized as having a certain status. The text indicates that other researchers recognized Nuttall’s work as groundbreaking because of its “convincing demonstration” related to the age of the ancient sculptures. In other words, the researchers recognized the groundbreaking status of Nuttall’s work. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “ensured” would mean to have guaranteed or made sure something was the case. The text states that other researchers gave Nuttall’s work recognition after it was published, but there’s no indication that they contributed to the work or had any involvement that would have allowed them to make sure the work would be groundbreaking. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that other researchers “denied,” or refused to admit or accept, that Nuttall’s work was groundbreaking; on the contrary, it indicates that researchers praised the work, recognizing it as groundbreaking due to its “convincing demonstration” related to the age of the ancient sculptures.

    optionB: "B. praises",
    optionC: "C. reports",
    optionD: "D. advises",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of environmental management along the US and Mexican border. In this context, "requires" means needs in order to perform a task. The text indicates that because ecosystems span the border, actions taken by the government on one side of the border can affect the environment in the nation on the other side of the border, which makes international cooperation crucial. In other words, because actions on one side of the US and Mexican border can affect the other side of the border, managing environmental matters along the border requires coordination between the two governments. Choice B is incorrect because "praises" in this context would mean to express a favorable judgment, but the text doesn’t describe approval expressed by anyone, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that environmental management itself praises intergovernmental coordination. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "reports" would mean gives an account. Although coordination between the US and Mexican governments likely would involve some sort of reporting, the text doesn’t describe any such practice. Choice D is incorrect.

Geographer Juan Herrera has shown, however, that if we shift our focus toward the way the movement manifested in comparatively low-prole neighborhood institutions and projects, we see participants espousing an array of political orientations and approaches to community activism.

    optionD:
      "D. It summarizes the conventional method for analyzing the Chicano movement, which the text suggests creates a misleading impression of the effectiveness of\nneighborhood institutions and projects.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The text begins by mentioning scholarly accounts of the Chicano movement, which the underlined portion describes as tending "to focus on the most militant, outspoken gures in the movement," making the movement as a whole seem uniformly radical. The text then indicates that the work of geographer Juan Herrera shows that focusing less on such militant gures and instead paying more attention to manifestations of the Chicano movement in less widely known neighborhood institutions and projects would reveal that the movement’s participants embraced a range of political orientations and approaches. Thus, the underlined portion describes a common approach to studying the Chicano movement that, according to the text, obscures the ideological diversity of the movement’s participants. Choice A is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does present a trend in scholarship on the Chicano movement, the text does not indicate that other scholars have reevaluated their methods in light of Herrera’s work. It only indicates that Herrera’s work suggests that the work of those other scholars does not provide a complete picture of the Chicano movement. Choice B is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does identify an aspect of the Chicano movement that the text indicates has been overemphasized, the text does not discuss the political orientations of the scholars whose work is mentioned in the text. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does summarize the conventional method for analyzing the Chicano movement, the rest of the text does not address the effectiveness of "comparatively low-prole neighborhood institutions and projects."

    optionA: "A. anticipate",
    optionB: "B. inspect",
    optionC: "C. reveal",
    optionD: "D. justify",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the helmets found in Denmark. In this context, “justify” means conrm or give reasons for. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical about the supposed Viking origin of two helmets found in Denmark. The radiocarbon dating of the helmets conducted by Vandkilde and colleagues demonstrates that the helmets date from the Nordic Bronze Age, making the helmets too old to have belonged to Vikings. This context supports the idea that the scholars’ skepticism is justied. Choice A is incorrect because “anticipate” means expect or come before, neither of which would make sense in context. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical of the idea that the helmets belonged to Vikings. Because the skepticism has existed for a long time, Vandkilde and colleagues’ research couldn’t be said to anticipate it. Instead, the radiocarbon dating results justify or conrm the scholar’s skepticism. Choice B is incorrect because “inspect” means examine or review, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. Research ndings are inanimate and therefore unable to inspect scholars’ skepticism. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues found that the helmets are from the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers’ ndings justify, not inspect, the scholars’ skepticism. Choice C is incorrect because “reveal” means uncover or report, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues tested the helmets and found that they date to the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore are much older than the Vikings.

    optionD: "D. Get his mother to reunite with",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. The expression “reconcile to” means “to cause (a person) to accept something dicult or disagreeable.” The text suggests that John wants his mother to accept his desire to travel, even though she doesn’t like that idea.

The text doesn’t suggest that John wants his mother to match his desire to travel. Rather, he wants her to accept his desire to travel even though she doesn’t like it. Choice D is incorrect. This is tempting, because it seems to pick up on the idea of people “reconciling” after a ght, but it actually doesn’t make sense.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. depleted",
    optionB: "B. homogeneous",
    optionC: "C. immature",
    optionD: "D. dispersed",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jha and Kremen’s nding about bees’ foraging behavior. In this context, “homogeneous” means uniform or of the same kind. The text indicates that some models predict that the distance that bees travel when they’re foraging declines as the density of owers increases. The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identied a circumstance in which bees don’t behave this way. Specically, if bees encounter “patches of low species richness”—that is, patches in which the owers are largely from the same species—they’ll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources. This context thus suggests that bees don’t behave as some models predict if the dense patches of owers the bees encounter are homogeneous. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave differently than some models predict if the bees encounter ower patches that are not rich in species, not if the owers are “depleted,” or emptied or reduced in quality or quantity. Although it could be true that bees are likely to leave depleted patches in search of more resources, the text doesn’t indicate that Jha and Kremen investigated that possibility. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that bees will not behave as some models predict if owers in patches are “immature,” or not fully developed. Instead, the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave contrary to some models’ predictions if the ower patches are not rich in species. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that bees’ behavior will be inconsistent with the predictions of some models if the ower patches that the bees encounter are of low species richness, not if the owers are in patches that are “dispersed,” or widely scattered. Although the text does describe bees as leaving patches that are not rich in species to forage elsewhere, there’s no suggestion that Jha and Kremen found that the distance between dense ower patches affects whether the bees behave as some models predict.",

In both plays, the all-female cast ______ an array of female characters, including a strong mother and several daughters dealing with individual struggles. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. engulfs",
    optionB: "B. encourages",
    optionC: "C. comprises",
    optionD: "D. provokes",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Gardley’s play. In this context, “comprises” means constitutes or makes up the totality of, and the text indicates that The House That Will Not Stand had an “all-female cast” that stands in some relationship to “an array of female characters” in the play. Because all cast members are female, the characters must be played by these female cast members; therefore the cast constitutes, or comprises, the collection of characters. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, “engulfs” would mean encloses or overwhelms, and although it is fairly common to describe an actor as embodying (or personifying realistically) a character, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the cast members enclosed or overwhelmed the characters they played. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “encourages” would mean inspires with courage or hope. Although the text does mention “a strong mother and several daughters dealing with individual struggles,” which might suggest that there are moments of encouragement among the characters during the play, there is nothing to suggest that the cast members encouraged the characters they portrayed. Choice D is incorrect because, in this context, “provokes” would mean instigates or incites to anger. Nothing in the text addresses provocation or what it might mean for actors to provoke the characters they are playing.",

    question:
      "Text 1 Despite its beautiful prose, The Guns of August, Barbara Tuchman’s 1962 analysis of the start of World War I, has certain weaknesses as a work of history. It fails to address events in Eastern Europe just before the outbreak of hostilities, thereby giving the impression that Germany was the war’s principal instigator. Had Tuchman consulted secondary works available to her by scholars such as Luigi Albertini, she would not have neglected the inuence of events in Eastern Europe on Germany’s actions. Text 2 Barbara Tuchman’s The Guns of August is an engrossing if dated introduction to World War I. Tuchman’s analysis of primary documents is laudable, but her main thesis that European powers committed themselves to a catastrophic outcome by refusing to deviate from military plans developed prior to the conict is implausibly reductive. Which choice best describes a difference in how the authors of Text 1 and Text 2 view Barbara Tuchman’s The Guns of August?",
    optionA:
      "A. The author of Text 1 argues that Tuchman should have relied more on the work of other historians, while the author of Text 2 implies that Tuchman’s most\ninteresting claims result from her original research.",

      "B. The author of Text 1 believes that the scope of Tuchman’s research led her to an incorrect interpretation, while the author of Text 2 believes that Tuchman’s\ncentral argument is overly simplisti",
    optionC:
      "C. The author of Text 1 asserts that the writing style of The Guns of August makes it worthwhile to read despite any perceived deciency in Tuchman’s research,\nwhile the author of Text 2 focuses exclusively on the weakness of Tuchman’s interpretation of events.",
    optionD:
      "D. The author of Text 1 claims that Tuchman would agree that World War I was largely due to events in Eastern Europe, while the author of Text 2 maintains that\nTuchman would say that Eastern European leaders were not committed to military plans in the same way that other leaders were.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. Both texts are critical of The Guns of August, but for different reasons: the author of Text 1 argues that Tuchman missed an important factor leading up to the war because she didn’t consult secondary sources, and the author of Text 2 argues that Tuchman’s main thesis is "reductive," which is a close synonym for "overly simplistic." Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t accurately describe the difference. This choice’s summary of Text 1 is accurate, but Text 2 never says that Tuchman’s most interesting claims result from her original research. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn’t accurately describe the difference. Text 1 never says that The Guns of August is worthwhile to read despite its research weaknesses. Text 2 does call out a weakness of Tuchman’s interpretation of events, but it also praises her analysis of primary sources. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn’t accurately describe the difference. Text 1 actually says that Tuchman "fails to address" the inuence of events in Eastern Europe, while Text 2 says that Tuchman’s thesis was that European powers (not Eastern European leaders) were committed to military plans.',

      "The following text is adapted from Karel Čapek’s 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots), translated by Paul Selver and Nigel Playfair in 1923. Fabry and Busman are telling Miss Glory why their company manufactures robots. FABRY: One Robot can replace two and a half workmen. The human machine, Miss Glory, was terribly imperfect. It had to be removed sooner or later. BUSMAN: It was too expensive. FABRY: It was not effective. It no longer answers the requirements of modern engineering. Nature has no idea of keeping pace with modern labor. As used in the text, what does the word “answers” most nearly mean?",

    optionB: "B. Rebuts",
    optionC: "C. Defends",
    optionD: "D. Fullls",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “answers” most nearly means fullls. In the text, Fabry and Busman claim that the robots manufactured by their company are more ecient than human workers, which they refer to as “the human machine.” Fabry observes that the human machine “no longer answers the requirements of modern engineering.” That is, human workers are incapable of meeting the rigorous needs of modern, industrialized workplaces. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts “answers” can mean explains, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because the topic under discussion is human beings’ inability to perform labor eciently, not their inability to engage in discussion or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “answers” can mean rebuts, or proves a claim or argument to be false, it wouldn’t make sense to speak of proving requirements to be false; requirements might or might not be reasonable, but they can’t be veried as truthful or untruthful, as claims or accusations can. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “answers” can mean defends against criticism, or justies, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because the opinion that Fabry expresses is that human workers can no longer fulll the requirements of modern workplaces, not that they have ceased to justify those requirements or to defend them against criticism; indeed, there is no suggestion in the text that workers ever defended those requirements.",

      "Text 1 In 2007, a team led by Alice Storey analyzed a chicken bone found in El Arenal, Chile, dating it to 1321–1407 CE—over a century before Europeans invaded the region, bringing their own chickens. Storey also found that the El Arenal chicken shared a unique genetic mutation with the ancient chicken breeds of the Polynesian Islands in the Pacic. Thus, Polynesian peoples, not later Europeans, probably rst introduced chickens to South America. Text 2 An Australian research team weakened the case for a Polynesian origin for the El Arenal chicken by conrming that the mutation identied by Storey has occurred in breeds from around the world. More recently, though, a team led by Agusto Luzuriaga-Neira found that South American chicken breeds and Polynesian breeds share other genetic markers that European breeds lack. Thus, the preponderance of evidence now favors a Polynesian origin. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By broadly agreeing with the claim but objecting that the timeline it presupposes conicts with the ndings of the genetic analysis conducted by Storey’s team",
    optionB:
      "B. By faulting the claim for implying that domestic animals couldn’t have been transferred from South America to the Polynesian Islands as well",
    optionC:
      "C. By critiquing the claim for being based on an assumption that before the European invasion of South America, the chickens of Europe were genetically uniform",
    optionD:
      "D. By noting that while the claim is persuasive, the ndings of Luzuriaga-Neira’s team provide stronger evidence for it than the ndings of the genetic analysis\nconducted by Storey do",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were rst brought to South America by Polynesian people. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Storey found is in chickens from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of a Polynesian origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say “[m]ore recently” Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but “that European breeds lack,” which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira’s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey’s evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues’ evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey’s evidence is. Choice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from “1321–1407 CE—over a century before Europeans invaded the region” and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey’s account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were rst brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way decient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens. There is nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the underlined sentence (Storey’s conclusion) is decient because it is based on an assumption about the genetic uniformity of European chickens.",

Miss Pyne sat by the window watching, in her best dress, looking stately and calm; she seldom went out now, and it was almost time for the carriage. Martha was just coming in from the garden with the strawberries, and with more owers in her apron. It was a bright cool evening in June, the golden robins sang in the elms, and the sun was going down behind the apple-trees at the foot of the garden. The beautiful old house stood wide open to the long-expected guest. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA: "A. To convey the worries brought about by a new guest",
    optionB: "B. To describe how the characters have changed over time",
    optionC: "C. To contrast the activity indoors with the stillness outside",
    optionD:
      "D. To depict the setting as the characters await a visitor’s arrival",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately reects the main purpose of the text. The text portrays Miss Pyne as awaiting the arrival of a carriage while Martha brings strawberries and owers from the garden into the house. The text also describes the surroundings of the scene, stating that Miss Pyne looks “stately and calm,” the evening is bright and cool, and birds are singing in the garden as the sun sets. Then the last sentence states that the house was “wide open to the long-expected guest,” which strongly suggests that Miss Pyne’s anticipation and Martha’s activities were in preparation for the guest who is expected to arrive in the carriage. Thus, the text depicts the setting and conveys what these characters are doing as they await the arrival of their visitor. Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that the characters feel any worry about the guest’s arrival. The text indicates that the guest was “long-expected,“ but characterizing Miss Pyne as “stately and calm” conicts with the idea that the characters are worried about the guest. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a moment in time when two characters are awaiting the arrival of a visitor rather than an extended period over which characters could be seen changing. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text describes the activity indoors (Miss Pyne sitting calmly), it describes a higher level of activity, not stillness, outside (Martha bringing fruit and owers and birds singing).",

It doesn’t require as much skill as creating physical art. “Painting” with a tablet and stylus is much easier than using paint and a brush: the technology is doing most of the work. Text 2 The painting programs used to create digital art involve more than just pressing a few buttons. In addition to knowing the fundamentals of art, digital artists need to be familiar with sophisticated software. Many artists will start by drawing an image on paper before transforming the piece to a digital format, where they can apply a variety of colors and techniques that would otherwise require many different traditional tools.

    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 2 would respond to the claims in Text 1. Both texts address skills needed to produce digital art. Text 1 claims that digital art doesn’t require the same amount of skill as creating physical art and that “the technology is doing most of the work.” Text 2 states that digital art requires “knowing the fundamentals of art” and that many digital artists begin their work on paper and then transfer it to a digital format using “sophisticated software” and “a variety of colors and techniques.” Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely insist that digital art requires artistic abilities even if it employs less traditional tools. Choice A is incorrect because neither text discusses nondigital means of displaying art. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 doesn’t address whether it’s harder to use a tablet and stylus than it is to use paint and a brush. Text 2 does argue that digital art requires skills that aren’t part of the traditional methods for producing art, but the text doesn’t address relative diculty.

    optionB: "B. important",
    optionC: "C. secretive",
    optionD: "D. ordinary",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Juarez. In this context, “important” means marked by signicant work or consequence. The text indicates that Juarez, who was the rst president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, became a certain kind of gure in Mexico’s history. It then supports that claim by describing some of the “many signicant accomplishments” from Juarez’s long tenure in oce. This context conveys that Juarez is a signicant and consequential gure in Mexico’s history. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on Juarez’s role as the rst president of Mexico from an Indigenous community and on his many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in oce; nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was “unpredictable,” or tended to behave in ways that couldn’t be predicted. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was a particularly “secretive” gure, or that he tended to keep things private or hidden from others. Instead, the text focuses on things that are known about Juarez: that he was the rst president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, that he had a lengthy tenure, and that his many major accomplishments included consolidating the national government’s authority and advancing Indigenous rights. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on the idea that Juarez, who was the rst president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, had many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in oce.

The O. khaungraae fossil consists of a rounded skull with a thin snout and a large eye socket. Because these features look like they are avian, or related to birds, researchers initially thought that the fossil might be the smallest avian dinosaur ever found. Text 2 Paleontologists were excited to discover a second small fossil that is similar to the strange O. khaungraae fossil but has part of the lower body along with a birdlike skull. Detailed studies of both fossils revealed several traits that are found in lizards but not in dinosaurs or birds. Therefore, paleontologists think the two creatures were probably unusual lizards, even though the skulls looked avian at rst.

    optionD:
      "D. It is reasonable because the O. khaungraae skull is about the same size as the skull of the second fossil but is shaped differently.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it reects what the paleontologists in Text 2 would most likely say about what the researchers in Text 1 initially thought. Text 1 focuses on the discovery of a strange fossil consisting of the skull of the extinct species Oculudentavis khaungraae. According to Text 1, the fossil has features that appear to be avian, or related to birds, which led researchers to initially think that the fossil might be a very small avian dinosaur. Text 2 begins by noting the discovery of a second fossil similar to the one discussed in Text 1, then explains that based on detailed studies of both fossils, paleontologists think that the two creatures were probably unusual lizards, even though the skulls appeared avian at rst. This suggests that the paleontologists in Text 2 recognize that the fossils do indeed look like they could be related to birds. For this reason, the paleontologists in Text 2 would most likely say that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1—that the fossil was avian—is understandable, even if the fossil is probably not avian but rather is from a lizard. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the fossils initially looked avian, so the paleontologists described in Text 2 wouldn’t be confused by the researchers in Text 1 initially thinking that O. khaungraae might be related to birds.

      "Text 1 It seems clear that emotional contagion (the unintentional transfer of an emotional state from one person to another) requires physical interaction and the observation of body language. After all, research shows that talking to someone who is smiling and expressing positive feelings often causes people to respond in a comparably positive way. Similarly, displays of nervous dgeting have been found to prompt others to begin behaving more nervously, too. Text 2 In an experiment using a social networking service, Zeyao Yang and Emilio Ferrara found evidence of emotional contagion in text-based online interactions. The researchers discovered that reading social media posts that expressed a positive outlook led people to make more positive posts themselves, while posts with a negative emotional tone led people to make more negative posts. Based on the texts, what would the researchers in Text 2 most likely say about the claim underlined in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. It perpetuates a awed understanding of emotional contagion, because there isn’t enough evidence to suggest that smiling is a sign of emotional contagion.",

    optionD:
      "D. It’s mostly accurate, because the social networking study conrmed that emotional contagion primarily occurs in response to negative emotions like\nnervousness.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it represents how the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 begins by asserting that the unintended transfer of feelings from one person to another, known as emotional contagion, seems to rely on both people being physically present and able to observe body language. Text 1 then references research that supports this assertion. Text 2 describes an experiment conducted by the researchers Yang and Ferrara in which they found evidence of emotional contagion in the absence of physical interaction, namely through text-based interactions on social media. The researchers in Text 2 wouldn’t completely agree with what is asserted in the underlined portion of Text 1 (that emotional contagion seems to require physical proximity), because their study, which used a social media networking service, found that physical interaction isn’t the only way that emotional contagion can take place. Thus, the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by stating that it reects an incomplete view of emotional contagion, because the phenomenon can occur without an in-person interaction. Choice A is incorrect. Although the researchers in Text 2 would likely agree that the underlined statement in Text 1 perpetuates a awed conclusion that emotional contagion requires physical interaction, Text 2 doesn’t address what the researchers thought about smiling as a sign of emotional contagion. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers in Text 2 wouldn’t say that the underlined claim in Text 1 is fairly persuasive. According to Text 2, the researchers conducted a study that found emotional contagion didn’t require physical interaction, because they found evidence of it in text-based online interactions. Choice D is incorrect because neither of the texts claim that emotional contagion primarily occurs when a person is exposed to negativity. Instead, Text 1 claims that physical interaction is required for emotional contagion to occur, and Text 2 describes a study that suggests emotional contagion can occur in text-based online interactions.",

    question:
      "The following text is from Walt Whitman’s 1860 poem “Calamus 24.” I HEAR it is charged against me that I seek to destroy institutions; But really I am neither for nor against institutions (What indeed have I in common with them?—Or what with the destruction of them?), Only I will establish in the Mannahatta [Manhattan] and in every city of These States, inland and seaboard, And in the elds and woods, and above every keel [ship] little or large, that dents the water, Without edices, or rules, or trustees, or any argument, The institution of the dear love of comrades. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. The speaker questions an increasingly prevalent attitude, then summarizes his worldview.",
    optionB:
      "B. The speaker regrets his isolation from others, then predicts a profound change in society.",
    optionC:
      "C. The speaker concedes his personal shortcomings, then boasts of his many achievements.",
    optionD:
      "D. The speaker addresses a criticism leveled against him, then announces a grand ambition of his.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the overall structure of the text. The speaker begins by stating that he has heard that others are accusing him of seeking to destroy institutions. The speaker then addresses this criticism by stating that he is “neither for nor against institutions.” Instead, the speaker states that his ultimate goal is to instill “the institution of the dear love of comrades” everywhere in the country. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as an address of criticism followed by an announcement of a grand ambition. Choice A is incorrect. While the speaker does address an opinion of him that he believes to be untrue, he doesn’t indicate that this attitude has become increasingly prevalent. The speaker also concludes by explaining his goal for the future rather than his current worldview. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray the speaker as isolated or regretful, and the speaker gestures toward a hope for societal change but doesn’t offer an explicit prediction that it will happen. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker addresses a criticism of him that he believes to be false; he doesn’t admit any personal shortcomings. Moreover, the speaker concludes by stating a goal he has rather than showcasing his achievements.",

      "The fashion resale market, in which consumers purchase secondhand clothing from stores and online sellers, generated nearly $30 billion globally in 2019. Expecting to see continued growth, some analysts ______ that revenues will more than double by 2028. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. produced",
    optionB: "B. denied",
    optionC: "C. worried",
    optionD: "D. predicted",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the fashion resale market’s continued growth. As used in this context, “predicted” means forecast, or indicated that something would happen in the future. The text indicates that the fashion resale market made a lot of money in 2019 and that some analysts expected the market to continue to grow. This context suggests that the analysts believed that the fashion resale market was going to make more money than it had already made, with the analysts indicating that revenues would more than double by 2028. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that some analysts “produced,” or manufactured or brought about, the increase in future revenues of the fashion resale market. The analysts themselves couldn’t have brought about the future revenue growth, since, as the text suggests, they were merely in the position of drawing conclusions about future fashion resale market revenue based on 2019 revenue. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they “denied,” or rejected, this notion. Nothing in the text supports the idea that these analysts thought the revenues wouldn’t grow. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they “worried,” or felt concerned, that revenue would signicantly increase by 2028. Nothing in the text suggests that the analysts felt concerned about the increase; rather, the text suggests that the increase would represent a favorable outcome, since it would mean that the fashion resale market grew to generate even more revenue.",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. pragmatic",
    optionB: "B. controversial",
    optionC: "C. extensive",
    optionD: "D. universal",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how Ofelia Zepeda has contributed to the eld of linguistics. As used in this context, “extensive” means having a wide or considerable extent. The text indicates that Zepeda’s many accomplishments in linguistics are varied, including teaching linguistics, writing poetry in more than one language, creating a grammar book, and co-founding a language institute. This context supports the idea that Zepeda’s contributions to the eld are extensive. Choice A is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda’s accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the rst part of the sentence. It wouldn’t make sense to say that achievements as a professor, poet and author, and co-founder of a language institute demonstrate that Zepeda’s contributions in her eld are “pragmatic,” or related to practical matters and not involving intellectual or artistic matters. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda’s accomplishments as a professor, poet and author, and co-founder of a language institute as examples to support the claim made in the rst part of the sentence. There’s no reason to believe that the positive achievements listed demonstrate that Zepeda’s contributions in her eld are “controversial,” or have caused disputes and opposing viewpoints. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “universal” would mean including or covering everything in a group. The sentence presents Zepeda’s accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the rst part of the sentence, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that these specic achievements—particularly as the author of a grammar book specic to the Tohono O’odham language—demonstrate that Zepeda’s contributions relate to everything in the eld of linguistics.",

      "The following text is from the 1913 story “The King’s Coin” by Emily Pauline Johnson, a Kanienkahagen (Mohawk) writer also known as Tekahionwake. Fox-Foot, a young Ojibwe man, is guiding a group of fur traders who are traveling by canoe and suspects that they are being followed. At supper time, Fox-Foot would allow no re to be built, no landing to be made, no trace of their passing to be left. They ate canned meat and marmalade, drank again of the stream and pushed on, until just at dusk they reached the edge of a long, still lake, with shores of granite and dense r forest. As used in the text, what does the word “trace” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Evidence",
    optionB: "B. Blemish",
    optionC: "C. Amount",
    optionD: "D. Sketch",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because the text indicates that Fox-Foot doesn’t let the group build a re or create a canoe landing when it’s time for supper. This context suggests that he doesn’t want anyone who might be following the group to see any sign of them or their activities. In other words, Fox-Foot doesn’t want there to be any trace, or evidence, of the group’s movements ("their passing") through the area. Choice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Fox-Foot doesn’t want the group to be detected, not that he doesn’t want their presence to create a blemish, or a spoiling aw, in the area; human activity could disturb a natural environment, but the context emphasizes that Fox-Foot is instead focused on avoiding giving any sign of the group’s movements through a place ("their passing") to anyone who might be following them. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on FoxFoot’s desire to avoid detection by those who might be following the group. This context conveys that Fox-Foot doesn’t want to create any signs or evidence of the group moving through a place ("their passing"), not that he doesn’t want to leave behind some quantity of their presence; indeed, it isn’t clear what an amount of a group’s movement would be. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the group has a sketch, or rough drawing, of their movements through that area ("their passing") that might be left behind. Rather, the context emphasizes that Fox-Foot is focused on ensuring that the group doesn’t give any kind of indication of their presence, as he wants to avoid detection by anyone who might be following the group.',

The rst sentence introduces Senju as a famous artist, while the next three sentences describe the dening features of his art, such as it only showing part of the waterfall and its origins in US art movements and Japanese techniques. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn’t provide examples of any other artists who use Senju’s techniques. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t describe any single famous painting or make comparisons between paintings. Choice D is incorrect.

      "The Cambrian explosion gets its name from the sudden appearance and rapid diversication of animal remains in the fossil record about 541 million years ago, during the Cambrian period. Some scientists argue that this ______ change in the fossil record might be because of a shift in many organisms to body types that were more likely to be preserved. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. catastrophic",
    optionB: "B. elusive",
    optionC: "C. abrupt",
    optionD: "D. imminent",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of the fossil record from the Cambrian period. In this context, “abrupt” means sudden. The text explains that the fossil record reects the unexpected appearance and rapid diversication, or increase in variety, of animal remains during the Cambrian period. This context establishes that these remains’ entry into the fossil record was sudden. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word “explosion” appears in the name of the event marked by the fossil record change, the text never suggests that the change was “catastrophic,” or disastrous. In context, “explosion” refers to the rapid diversication, or the swift increase in variety, of animal remains in the fossil record—a phenomenon that the text presents in a relatively neutral manner, without commenting on whether it was negative or positive. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that the change toward greater diversication is “elusive,” or dicult to locate, in the fossil record. Rather, the text notes that the change occurred about 541 million years ago, suggesting that scientists have indeed been able to locate it. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to describe the change in the fossil record as “imminent,” or about to occur, since the text indicates that the change already occurred millions of years ago.",

    optionA: "A. haphazard",
    optionB: "B. premeditated",
    optionC: "C. inspirational",
    optionD: "D. fruitless",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Yu’s novel. In this context, “haphazard” means marked by a lack of plan or order. The text indicates that the quest featured in the novel, which involves the protagonist bouncing across time, is chaotic and causes the reader to often wonder what will happen. This context suggests that the protagonist’s journey seems to be marked by a lack of order. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the journey featured in Yu’s novel involves a character “ricocheting chaotically,” or bouncing in a disordered way, across time and causes the reader to often wonder what will happen. It wouldn’t make sense to say that a chaotic journey seems “premeditated,” or characterized by forethought and planning. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t give any indication that readers regard the journey in Yu’s novel as “inspirational,” or as causing extraordinarily creative or brilliant thoughts or actions; instead, the text focuses on the idea that the protagonist’s journey is chaotic, or disordered, and doesn’t give readers a clear sense of what will happen. Choice D is incorrect. Rather than suggesting that the journey featured in Yu’s novel is “fruitless,” or has an unsuccessful outcome, the text focuses on the idea that while reading about the protagonist’s chaotic movements across time, readers are often unsure of what will happen—that is, they don’t know whether the protagonist will be successful in nding his father.",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. neglected",
    optionB: "B. redundant",
    optionC: "C. ongoing",
    optionD: "D. uniform",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. The text tells us that the samples are too "small scale" to reect the composition of the asteroid, which probably doesn’t show the same variation on a large scale. This suggests that the mineral composition of the samples are unlikely to be exactly the same from sample to sample. Choice A is incorrect. "Neglected" means "suffering a lack of proper care" or "abandoned," which doesn’t work here. The text never suggests that the distribution of minerals in the samples would be neglected, so this statement doesn’t logically follow. Choice B is incorrect. "Redundant" means "not or no longer useful or needed," which is too strong. The text doesn’t suggest that the variation between the samples isn’t a useful nding at all—just that we can’t assume that the largescale composition of the asteroid will show the same variation. But the composition of the samples might be useful for something else. Choice C is incorrect.

Fossils of various plant-eating mammals have been found in China, including species like Vilevolodon diplomylos, which Luo says could glide like a ying squirrel.

    optionA: "A. predatory",
    optionB: "B. obscure",
    optionC: "C. diverse",
    optionD: "D. localized",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the kinds of mammals alive during the Mesozoic era. As used in this context, “diverse” means to have a signicant amount of variety. The text indicates that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals can’t be characterized in a certain way, then contrasts the view put forward by those scientists with Luo’s research, which shows that Mesozoic mammals “weren’t all ground-dwelling insectivores” and instead were “various.” This context suggests that some scientists have viewed Mesozoic mammals as being all alike, or not a very diverse group. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren’t very “predatory,” or that they didn’t prey on other animals, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo’s research showing that Mesozoic mammals “weren’t all ground-dwelling insectivores.” This context suggests that some scientists have regarded Mesozoic mammals as all being insectivores, or animals that prey on insects, not that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals didn’t prey on other animals. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren’t very “obscure,” or concealed or not well known, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo’s research showing that Mesozoic mammals were a varied group. There’s no contrast between saying that the mammals weren’t concealed or well known and the mammals being varied. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren’t very “localized,” or conned to a particular area, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo’s research showing that Mesozoic mammals were a varied group. There’s no contrast between saying that the mammals weren’t localized and the mammals being varied.

    optionB: "B. interpretation",
    optionC: "C. collaboration",
    optionD: "D. commercialization",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of The Mule Bone, a play that Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes wrote together. In this context, “collaboration” means working together with someone to write a literary work. The text indicates that most writers prefer to work alone and that working together destroyed the friendship between Hurston and Hughes. This establishes that The Mule Bone is a relatively rare example of collaboration in literature. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “characterization” would mean a literary work’s portrayal of characters’ psychological experiences and motivations, but the text doesn’t discuss characterization in The Mule Bone specically or in collaborative works more generally. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “interpretation” would mean the explanation of a literary work’s meaning or signicance, but the text doesn’t discuss how readers or critics have interpreted The Mule Bone; instead, the text discusses how the play was written collaboratively and how the writing process affected the two authors. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “commercialization” would mean writing a literary work in such a way as to ensure its commercial appeal, but the text never discusses commercial appeal as a factor in the writing of The Mule Bone specically or the writing of collaborative works more generally.",

    optionB: "B. withdraw",
    optionC: "C. underscore",
    optionD: "D. invalidate",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the economist’s claim about sales of personal electronic devices. In this context, “invalidate” most nearly means nullify or make invalid. The text indicates that interruptions in the supply of microchips for personal electronics “have challenged” the economist’s claim that sales of personal electronics will show strong growth in the coming months. The text goes on to clarify the effect of the delays on the economist’s projection, stating that the delays are very likely to extend the time frame over which the projected growth in sales will occur. This context suggests that the delays are unlikely to invalidate the economist’s projection entirely—the delays will probably alter the time frame of the projection, not nullify it or make it invalid. Choice A is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “dispute,” or argue against, the economist’s projection wouldn’t make sense. Since the delays are an inanimate circumstance, they couldn’t argue against a prediction about the sales of personal electronics. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “withdraw,” or remove from consideration, the economist’s projection wouldn’t make sense. Although the economist could withdraw her projection because of the delays, the delays themselves couldn’t withdraw her projection since they’re an inanimate circumstance and thus can’t choose to remove something from consideration. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the delays will “underscore,” or emphasize, the economist’s projection.

      'Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole.

The underlined sentence states that the map "demonstrates a vast amount of topographic knowledge" and mentions that it features the "specic names of mountains and rivers" and includes the rst-known sketch of the Missouri River’s drainage network. These are all characteristics that indicate that the map was executed with remarkable skill. Thus, the underlined sentence identies some reasons why the map is impressive. Choice A is incorrect. Though the sentence after the underlined sentence in the text mentions that Ac Ko Mok Ki included information about other tribes on his map, the underlined sentence itself does not address this topic.

The text says that Sumner helped to found the psychology department at historically Black Howard University in 1930. This is evidence that Sumner supported increasing the opportunity for Black students to study psychology. Choice B is incorrect because the phrase “supplement to,” or addition to, wouldn’t make sense in context.

    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about how, for Schoenemann, a damaged trilobite fossil was informative. In context, “offered” means provided or gave. The text suggests that although it may seem counterintuitive, a broken fossilized trilobite allowed Schoenemann to observe more details of the trilobite’s eye than an intact fossilized trilobite would. This context conveys the idea that a damaged fossil offered, or provided, fresh insight into the structure of a trilobite’s eye. Choice A is incorrect because “resolved” means determined or gured out, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text focuses on how Schoenemann was able to get more information from a broken fossil than an intact one. Although the damaged fossil may have allowed her to determine certain information, as an inanimate object the fossil isn’t capable of resolving anything. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the broken part of a trilobite fossil “adjusted,” or changed or modied, fresh insight wouldn’t make sense in this context.

      "Works of moral philosophy, such as Plato’s Republic or Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, are partly concerned with how to live a morally good life. But philosopher Jonathan Barnes argues that works that present a method of living such a life without also supplying a motive are inherently useful only to those already wishing to be morally good—those with no desire for moral goodness will not choose to follow their rules. However, some works of moral philosophy attempt to describe what constitutes a morally good life while also proposing reasons for living one. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",

Choice B is incorrect. This is too extreme. The text never mentions whether the two works are popular or not, and it never argues that these works don’t serve their intended purpose of describing how to live a morally good life.

    question:
      "Industrial activity is often assumed to be a threat to wildlife, but that isn’t always so. Consider the silver-studded blue buttery (Plebejus argus): as forest growth has reduced grasslands in northern Germany, many of these butteries have left meadow habitats and are now thriving in active limestone quarries. In a survey of multiple active quarries and patches of maintained grassland, an ecologist found silver-studded blue butteries in 100% of the quarries but only 57% of the grassland patches. Moreover, buttery populations in the quarries were four times larger than those in the meadows. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",

    optionD:
      "D. It provides a denition for an unfamiliar term that is central to the main argument in the text.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence presents the general claim that industrial activity is not always a threat to wildlife. The underlined portion of the sentence that follows suggests that the silver-studded blue buttery is an example of wildlife thriving in areas of industrial activity: active limestone quarries. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to introduce a specic example in support of the general claim in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect. Although the rst sentence indicates that “industrial activity is often assumed” to harm wildlife, in the case of the silver-studded blue buttery the text mentions neither an assumption about this species nor any challenge to such an assumption. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions only one study: the “survey.” Additional studies are not mentioned in the text.

      "The following text is from Lucy Maud Montgomery’s 1908 novel Anne of Green Gables. Anne, an eleven-year-old girl, has come to live on a farm with a woman named Marilla in Nova Scotia, Canada. Anne reveled in the world of color about her. “Oh, Marilla,” she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs, “I’m so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn’t it? Look at these maple branches. Don’t they give you a thrill—several thrills? I’m going to decorate my room with them.” “Messy things,” said Marilla, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed. “You clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors stuff, Anne. Bedrooms were made to sleep in.” Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To demonstrate that Anne has a newly developed appreciation of nature",
    optionB: "B. To describe an argument that Anne and Marilla often have",
    optionC:
      "C. To emphasize Marilla’s disapproval of how Anne has decorated her room",
    optionD:
      "D. To show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by noting that Anne “reveled in the world of color about her”—that is, she takes great delight in colorful things. It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it. The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped “aesthetic sense,” or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as “messy things” and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside. This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities. Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne’s appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn’t show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla’s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne’s personality.",

    optionB: "B. uctuations in",
    optionC: "C. calibrations with",
    optionD: "D. incentives for",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of solar energy collection and storage. In this context, "uctuations in" means irregular changes in. The text notes that economists recommend that countries that want to rely more on solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) should attempt to expand their storage capacity. The text goes on to explain that having a large amount of stored solar energy can lessen the negative effect of "unpredictable shifts in cloud cover and haze"—that is, unpredictable changes in environmental conditions that at times limit sunlight. This context suggests that having ample solar energy stored and ready to use can mitigate the issue of uctuations in solar energy collection caused by irregular patterns of sunlight availability. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "developments of solar energy collection" would most clearly refer to the creation of ways to collect solar energy (energy captured from sunlight). The text focuses on collection and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight ("cloud cover and haze"); there’s no reason to think that the creation of new collection methods would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "calibrations with" would most clearly refer to precise adjustments for a particular purpose. The text focuses on the collection of solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight ("cloud cover and haze"); there’s no reason to think that precision in something related to solar energy collection would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated. Choice D is incorrect. The text focuses on the collection of solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight ("cloud cover and haze"); nothing in the text suggests that "incentives for," or rewards for, solar energy collection would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated, especially in countries that want to rely more on solar energy than they already do.',

    optionB: "B. rudimentary",
    optionC: "C. evolving",
    optionD: "D. advantageous",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of single-celled organism behavior. As used in this context, “rudimentary” means basic or unsophisticated. According to the text, a study of the single-celled protozoan Stentor roeseli showed that the organisms can switch strategies for escaping certain stimuli, “sophisticatedly ‘changing their minds’” and using new strategies should other strategies fail. This context suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic or rudimentary, since the study showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “aggressive,” or threatening. Rather, the text suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic, since the study of Stentor roeseli showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “evolving,” or advancing. Rather, the text suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic, since the study of Stentor roeseli showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli.

[Atlante] gave this letter to Charlot; who immediately ran into the balcony with it, where she still found Rinaldo in a melancholy posture, leaning his head on his hand: She showed him the letter, but was afraid to toss it to him, for fear it might fall to the ground; so he ran and fetched a long cane, which he cleft at one end, and held it while she put the letter into the cleft, and stayed not to hear what he said to it. But never was man so transported with joy, as he was at the reading of this letter; it gives him new wounds; for to the generous, nothing obliges love so much as love.

    optionD:
      "D. It reveals the inspiration behind a character’s letter, and then emphasizes the excitement that another character feels upon receiving that letter.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The narrator begins by explaining how Charlot carefully delivers Atlante’s letter to Rinaldo, and then relates that Rinaldo feels “transported with joy” after reading the letter. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description of the delivery of a letter followed by the portrayal of a character’s happiness after reading the letter. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the letter has been written; there’s no explanation why another character hasn’t written one. In addition, the text’s description of Rinaldo “in a melancholy posture” suggests that he’s sad and thoughtful, not that he’s desperate to receive the letter. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Charlot won’t toss the letter to Rinaldo because she doesn’t want it to fall, the text doesn’t refer to the contents of the letter. Instead, the text describes how happy Rinaldo feels after reading it. Choice D is incorrect.

The researchers provided no external rewards (such as food) to encourage these interactions. The bees simply appeared to be playing— and for no other reason than because they were having fun. Text 2 Insects do not have cortexes or other brain areas associated with emotions in humans. Still, Galpayage and her team have shown that bumblebees may engage in play, possibly experiencing some kind of positive emotional state. Other studies have suggested that bees experience negative emotional states (for example, stress), but as Galpayage and her team have acknowledged, emotions in insects, if they do indeed exist, are likely very rudimentary.

Such ndings support the consensus view among researchers of curiosity: namely, that curiosity is not instrumental but instead represents a drive to acquire information for its own sake. Text 2 While acknowledging that acquiring information is a powerful motivator, Rachit Dubey and colleagues ran an experiment to test whether emphasizing the usefulness of scientic information could increase curiosity about it. They found that when research involving rats and fruit ies was presented as having medical applications for humans, participants expressed greater interest in learning about it than when the research was not presented as useful.

      "Text 1 Conventional wisdom long held that human social systems evolved in stages, beginning with hunter-gatherers forming small bands of members with roughly equal status. The shift to agriculture about 12,000 years ago sparked population growth that led to the emergence of groups with hierarchical structures: associations of clans rst, then chiefdoms, and nally, bureaucratic states. Text 2 In a 2021 book, anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow maintain that humans have always been socially exible, alternately forming systems based on hierarchy and collective ones with decentralized leadership. The authors point to evidence that as far back as 50,000 years ago some huntergatherers adjusted their social structures seasonally, at times dispersing in small groups but also assembling into communities that included esteemed individuals. Based on the texts, how would Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” presented in Text 1?",

    optionD:
      "D. By challenging the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it describes the most likely way that Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) would respond to the “conventional wisdom” presented in Text 1. According to Text 1, the conventional wisdom about human social systems is that they developed through stages, beginning with hunter-gatherer bands, then moving to clan associations, then chiefdoms, and nally arriving at states with bureaucratic structures. Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow believe that human social systems have been exible, shifting between different types of structures, including both hierarchical and collective systems, and that these shifts may have even occurred seasonally. This suggests that Graeber and Wengrow would dispute the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that Graeber and Wengrow believe that decentralized collective societies are more signicant than hierarchical systems. Text 2 is focused on Graeber and Wengrow’s view that humans have exibly shifted among various social structures, not on the importance of particular structures relative to others. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t include any information suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow believe that hierarchies didn’t emerge until after the rise of agriculture. In fact, Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow cite evidence suggesting that some hunter-gatherer groups formed social structures with hierarchical elements (“communities that included esteemed individuals”) 50,000 years ago, long before the rise of agriculture, which Text 1 says occurred around 12,000 years ago. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no information in Text 2 suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow would challenge the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure. Although Text 1 does indicate that hunter-gatherer groups are assumed to be the earliest human social system, Text 2 says only that Graeber and Wengrow believe that some hunter-gatherer groups made use of different social structures at different times.

In a 2021 study of environmental DNA (eDNA)—genetic material shed into the environment by organisms—in the Arctic, Yucheng Wang and colleagues found mammoth eDNA in sedimentary layers formed millennia later, around 4 kyr ago. To account for this discrepancy, Joshua H. Miller and Carl Simpson proposed that arctic temperatures could preserve a mammoth carcass on the surface, allowing it to leach DNA into the environment, for several thousand years. Text 2 Wang and colleagues concede that eDNA contains DNA from both living organisms and carcasses, but for DNA to leach from remains over several millennia requires that the remains be perpetually on the surface.

    optionD: "D. encountering",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of programs that encourage money to cycle within a community. In this context, "instituting" means initiating. The text indicates that making purchases at small local businesses can help keep money cycling within a community. The text goes on to state that some cities are establishing incentives to promote small business shopping. This context supports the idea that some cities are instituting programs to encourage this consumer behavior. Choice B is incorrect because saying that some cities are "occupying," or forcibly holding possession or control of, programs that encourage shoppers to make purchases at small local businesses wouldn’t make sense in context. The text doesn’t discuss who controls these programs but instead indicates that some cities are establishing incentives that encourage shoppers to make purchases at small local businesses. Furthermore, it wouldn’t make sense to say that a city is occupying a program. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that cities are "underestimating," or failing to understand the value of, programs that encourage consumers to shop at small local businesses. The text indicates that some cities are establishing incentives to encourage small business shopping, which suggests that these cities understand the value of such programs. Choice D is incorrect because saying that some cities are "encountering," or coming into contact with, programs that encourage consumers to shop at small local businesses wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that some cities are already establishing incentives to encourage shoppers to make purchases at small businesses. This context suggests that the cities are instituting the programs, not that they are encountering them.',

    optionB: "B. exactitude",
    optionC: "C. resilience",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the method the inhabitants of the Mexica empire used to track time. In this context, "exactitude" means precision. The text indicates that the Mexica used the sun’s position relative to various natural landmarks to track the passage of time, explaining that such methods allowed the Mexica to accurately determine the dates of important events such as solstices. This context supports the idea that the Mexica people were able to track time with a high degree of precision, or exactitude. Choice A is incorrect because in this context "precariousness" would mean instability, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the method used by the Mexica people to track time was unstable or produced unstable results. Rather, the text indicates that the method yielded precise results, allowing the Mexica to accurately determine the dates of signicant events. Choice C is incorrect because in this context "resilience" would mean persistence, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the Mexica worked stubbornly in spite of obstacles in order to track time. Choice D is incorrect because in this context "inconspicuousness" would mean discreetness, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the Mexica wanted to track time without being noticed.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text.

She goes on to explain that she is "quick" and "tough." Based on these characteristics, she thinks she has a chance to join the team. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to explain why the narrator thinks she might make the basketball team. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses solely on basketball and doesn’t mention any other kinds of sports. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe aspects of the game of basketball. Instead, it provides the narrator’s reasoning for thinking that she might make her school basketball team.

    question:
      "Text 1 Although food writing is one of the most widely read genres in the United States, literary scholars have long neglected it. And within this genre, cookbooks attract the least scholarly attention of all, regardless of how well written they may be. This is especially true of works dedicated to regional US cuisines, whose complexity and historical signicance are often overlooked. Text 2 With her 1976 cookbook The Taste of Country Cooking, Edna Lewis popularized the rened Southern cooking she had grown up with in Freetown, an all-Black community in Virginia. She also set a new standard for cookbook writing: the recipes and memoir passages interspersing them are written in prose more elegant than that of most novels. Yet despite its inarguable value as a piece of writing, Lewis’s masterpiece has received almost no attention from literary scholars. Based on the two texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely regard the situation presented in the underlined sentence in Text 2?",
    optionA:
      "A. As typical, because scholars are dismissive of literary works that achieve popularity with the general public",
    optionB:
      "B. As unsurprising, because scholars tend to overlook the literary value of food writing in general and of regional cookbooks in particular",
    optionC:
      "C. As justiable, because Lewis incorporated memoir into The Taste of Country Cooking, thus undermining its status as a cookbook",
    optionD:
      "D. As inevitable, because The Taste of Country Cooking was marketed to readers of food writing and not to readers of other genres",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. Text 1 states that literary scholars ignore regional cookbooks most of all, even when they have historical signicance and are well written. So the author of Text 1 wouldn’t be surprised that scholars ignored Edna Lewis’s cookbook. Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how the author of Text 1 would regard the situation. Text 1 never suggests that scholars are dismissive of popular works in general. Instead, Text 1 says that scholars ignore food writing specically, despite its popularity—and despite the fact that it can be historically signicant and complex. Choice C is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how the author of Text 1 would regard the situation. Text 1 never suggests that elements of other genres should be kept out of cookbooks. Choice D is incorrect.

      "The following text is from Frances Hodgson Burnett’s 1911 novel The Secret Garden. Mary, a young girl, is outside trying her new jump rope. The sun was shining and a little wind was blowing—not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned earth with it. She skipped round the fountain garden, and up one walk and down another. As used in the text, what does the word “rough” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Harsh",
    optionB: "B. Scratchy",
    optionC: "C. Basic",
    optionD: "D. Vague",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "rough" most nearly means harsh, or forceful and unpleasant. The text describes Mary’s surroundings as she plays: the sun is out and there’s "a little wind." To further illustrate the wind, the narrator contrasts the word "rough" with a description of the wind blowing in "delightful little gusts," suggesting that the wind is not unpleasant or harsh at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts "rough" objects, or objects with irregular surfaces, can sometimes be scratchy, rough doesn’t mean scratchy in this context. The text explains that the wind is not rough but rather gentle, "delightful little gusts," which suggests that the use of "rough" here is referring to the degree of force of the wind. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wind wasn’t "basic," or simple and uncomplicated. Instead, the text describes the wind as blowing not roughly or harshly but in "delightful little gusts." Choice D is incorrect because the word "vague" means not clearly expressed or seen. Nothing in the text indicates that the wind was barely noticeable to Mary as she played outside, but rather the text states that it was delightful.',

      "The following text is adapted from Amy Lowell’s 1912 poem “Summer.” It is summer, glorious, deep-toned summer, The very crown of nature’s changing year When all her surging life is at its full. To me alone it is a time of pause, A void and silent space between two worlds, When inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps, Gathering strength for efforts yet to come. As used in the text, what does the phrase “a void” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. A useless",
    optionB: "B. An empty",
    optionC: "C. A forgotten",
    optionD: "D. An incomplete",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, a span of time is described as "a void" space, which most nearly means an empty or vacant one. In the text, the speaker describes summertime in counterintuitive terms: although nature’s "surging life is at its full" during the season, the speaker feels summer to be "a time of pause, / A void and silent space between two worlds." The speaker says further that during summer, "feeling sleeps / Gathering strength" for future efforts. Thus, the speaker regards summer as an empty stretch of time, to be followed by a period of greater activity. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does present summer as a time of inactivity, it doesn’t characterize that inactivity as useless, or as having no purpose; in fact, the speaker regards summer as a time when "feeling" gathers "strength for efforts yet to come." Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes summer as a time "when inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps," it doesn’t discuss the season’s relationship to the speaker’s memory or suggest that summer can easily be forgotten. Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, "void" can mean devoid of, or lacking, a particular element, and such a lack could be conceived of as incompleteness. However, the text doesn’t portray summer as not being complete or whole; instead, it characterizes vacancy or inactivity as being an essential quality of the season, as experienced by the speaker.',

    correctAnswer: 2,

Throughout the text, the speaker characterizes nighttime as if it were a person who wears clothing (“a garment” that is “velvet soft” and “violet blue”) and a veil “over her face” and who moves her hands “slowly with their gemstarred light” through her dark hair. Thus, the text is structured as an extended comparison of night to a human being. Choice A is incorrect because the text never mentions any particular location; instead, it focuses on presenting a single description of night as a person with certain clothing and features. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t make any reference to the sun or sunrise; instead, it focuses on presenting a single image of night as a person with certain clothing and features.

    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jemisin’s writing. In this context, “conform to” means to act in accordance with something. The text suggests that in her science ction writing, Jemisin’s willingness to go against expectations and not use plots and themes that seem to follow a formula reects how she treats the standard practices of the genre. This context conveys that Jemisin chooses not to act in accordance with those conventions. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, “question” would mean doubt or object to. The text indicates that Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes in her science ction writing, suggesting that she may actually object to those conventions of the genre, not that she chooses not to question them. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that in her science ction writing, Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes.

    optionB: "B. atypical",
    optionC: "C. lucrative",
    optionD: "D. tedious",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Samuel R. Delany’s character Rydra Wong. As used in this context, “atypical” would mean unrepresentative or not common. The text indicates that Wong is one of “nearly a dozen” characters in Delany’s novels who are poets or writers. This context conveys that being a poet isn’t an atypical occupation for a character in one of Delany’s works. Choice A is incorrect because “infallible” means to be accurate or without fault, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the fact that Delany has written many characters who are poets and writers. This context suggests that the occupation isn’t atypical for Delany, not that the occupation isn’t infallible, or problematic. Choice C is incorrect because “lucrative” means to be protable, which wouldn’t make sense in context. If writing poet characters weren’t protable, it wouldn’t be logical to explain this by citing that Delany gave many of his characters the same occupation. Choice D is incorrect because “tedious” means to be boring, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the fact that Delany has written many characters who are poets and writers.

    optionB: "B. an overtly",
    optionC: "C. a cordially",
    optionD: "D. an inadvertently",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Yaszek’s introduction to her science ction anthology. In this context "overtly" means openly or without concealment. The text draws a contrast between the lack of "deliberately signaled" political themes in women-authored science ction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about women-authored science ction from the 1970s. This contrast implies that the work from the 1970s did clearly reect feminist political themes. In other words, the text indicates that unlike women who wrote science ction in the 1920s to the 1960s, the women who wrote science ction in the 1970s expressed overtly feminist themes. Choice A is incorrect. In this context "prudently" would mean cautiously, which might plausibly describe the women who wrote science ction from the 1920s to the 1960s, in that they tended to avoid revealing their political views; however, the text contrasts these authors with the women writing science ction in the 1970s, thereby suggesting that the authors writing in the 1970s were not restrained in that way. Choice C is incorrect because in this context "cordially" would mean politely, and nothing in the text indicates that politeness was a signicant factor for women writing science ction either from the 1920s to the 1960s or in the 1970s. The text draws a contrast between the lack of "deliberately signaled" political themes in women-authored science ction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about women-authored science ction from the 1970s. It’s unclear how "less deliberately signaled" politics and an increasing sense of politeness toward feminism would constitute a meaningful contrast. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "inadvertently" would mean unintentionally, and nothing in the text suggests that Yaszek thought the feminist elements of the women-authored science ction from the 1970s arose without deliberate effort.',

    optionB: "B. representative of",
    optionC: "C. overshadowed by",
    optionD: "D. irrelevant to",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the factors that inuence peoples’ decisions to move to a different state. As used in this context, “overshadowed by” means to be surpassed by or caused to seem less important than other factors affecting a move. The text indicates that, according to a US tax policy expert, when people think about an interstate move, state taxes have little effect on their decisions, while employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate have a very strong effect. This context suggests that people consider these other factors to be more important than state taxes. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that state taxes aren’t as important a consideration as other factors when people are thinking of moving to another state. The context doesn’t suggest that state taxes are “consistent with,” or in agreement with these other factors. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that state taxes are “representative of,” or typical of, other factors. Taxes aren’t an example of employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate, which are the other factors listed in the text. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that state taxes are “irrelevant to,” or unconnected or unimportant to other factors. State taxes are irrelevant to peoples’ decisions, not to other factors. In other words, although the text suggests that state taxes may be irrelevant to people considering a move to another state, the other factors mentioned in the text, such as employment opportunities, are unable to have an opinion about state taxes. Furthermore, the text indicates that signicant differences in state taxes have almost no effect on peoples’ choices to move, but they aren’t completely unimportant.",

It was only a little out-of-the-way store which subsisted chiey on the framing of pictures. The old man looked around at his views of the city, his pictures of cats and dogs, his aming bits of landscape. “Don’t belong in here,” he fumed.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by stating that the new picture “failed to t in” with the other items that the shop owner has. The text goes on to illustrate that point by describing the other pictures the shop owner has, indicating that the shop owner is fuming because he doesn’t think the new picture belongs in the store. In the second paragraph, however, the text indicates that the shop owner is “secretly proud of his acquisition.” The main purpose of the text is thus to reveal the shop owner’s conicted feelings about the new picture.

According to historian Eleanor Janega, most medieval towns in Europe had at least one public bathhouse, which often offered both full-immersion baths and—more affordably—steam baths. While such amenities were available mainly to town dwellers, regular bathing in rivers and streams or daily sponge baths at home were common practices throughout medieval Europe. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion?",
    optionA:

      "C. It concedes that not all people in medieval Europe had access to public bathhouses.",
    optionD:
      "D. It explains why Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively describes the function of the underlined portion. The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega’s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn’t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe—nor does any portion of the text. The text mentions Janega in passing, but it doesn’t go into detail about why she decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.",

Klein isn’t directly providing any thoughtful examination of the conventions of photography: he’s just breaking all the rules. Choice C is incorrect. "Respected" can mean "admired" or "followed" (as in the case of conventions). It’s clear that Klein didn’t respect conventions, given his use of photographic features that were generally considered "aws." Choice D is incorrect. "Prevented" means "stopped," and Klein did not stop the conventions—they still existed. Instead, he made images that were seen as "awed" under those conventions.',

      "The following text is from Herman Melville’s 1854 novel The Lightning-rod Man. The stranger still stood in the exact middle of the cottage, where he had rst planted himself. His singularity impelled a closer scrutiny. A lean, gloomy gure. Hair dark and lank, mattedly streaked over his brow. His sunken pitfalls of eyes were ringed by indigo halos, and played with an innocuous sort of lightning: the gleam without the bolt. The whole man was dripping. He stood in a puddle on the bare oak oor: his strange walking-stick vertically resting at his side.

      "Horizontal gene transfer occurs when an organism of one species acquires genetic material from an organism of another species through nonreproductive means. The genetic material can then be transferred “vertically” in the second species—that is, through reproductive inheritance. Scientist Atma Ivancevic and her team have hypothesized infection by invertebrate parasites as a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer between vertebrate species: while feeding, a parasite could acquire a gene from one host, then relocate to a host from a different vertebrate species and transfer the gene to it in turn. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",
    optionA:
      "A. It explains why parasites are less susceptible to horizontal gene transfer than their hosts are.",

For her album Orchestral Powwow, Derksen composed new songs in the style of traditional powwow music that were accompanied by classical arrangements played by an orchestra. But where an orchestra would normally follow the directions of a conductor, the musicians on Orchestral Powwow are led by the beat of a powwow drum.

    optionD:
      "D. To establish a contrast between Derksen’s classical training and her Cree heritage",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to discuss how Derksen’s compositions incorporate elements from both Indigenous and classical music. After introducing Derksen, the text describes how the songs Derksen composed for her album Orchestral Powwow feature aspects of the two musical traditions. Specically, the text notes that Derksen wrote songs in the style of traditional powwow music but accompanied them with classical arrangements played by an orchestra that followed the beat of a powwow drum rather than the directions of a conductor. In this way, Derksen’s compositions blend different cultures. Choice B is incorrect because although the text suggests that Derksen’s songs contain innovative elements since they blend styles from two different musical traditions, it doesn’t discuss whether her compositions constitute a new style of music, let alone whether Derksen should be recognized for creating a new style of music. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any diculties Derksen encountered when producing her album. Rather, the text describes how the songs on the album exemplify how Derksen combines music from two different cultures. Choice D is incorrect because although the text mentions Derksen’s Cree heritage and suggests that she relies on knowledge of both Indigenous and classical music when she composes her songs, it doesn’t discuss her musical training.

      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the archaeologists’ study of the ancient amphitheater in Switzerland. In this context, “provide” means make available or supply. The text states that the archaeologists believe that the amphitheater dates to the fourth century CE.

This context suggests that these discoveries provide evidence for the archaeologists’ theory about the dating of the amphitheater. Choice A is incorrect because the archaeologists’ discoveries are presented as supplying evidence in favor of their theory about the dating of the amphitheater, not something that would “dismiss,” or reject serious consideration of, evidence for that theory. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the archaeologists’ discoveries would “regulate,” or govern or bring order to, evidence for the archaeologists’ theory about the dating of the amphitheater. The discoveries are presented as supplying evidence for the archaeologists’ theory, not as changing how evidence for the theory is controlled or ordered.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of Jeyifous’s series of images for the 2020 exhibition. In this context, “created” means produced. The text explains that Jeyifous, a photographer and neurobiologist, photographed adults who had appeared as children in posters from the 1970s, then combined those photographs with magnied images of the adults’ cells—a process that resulted in what he called “micro and macro portraiture.” This context suggests that Jeyifous drew on his dual interests in photography and neurobiology to produce the images for display in the exhibition. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Jeyifous “validated,” or corroborated, the series of images. The text describes Jeyifous’s process for composing the images but doesn’t describe Jeyifous making an effort to evaluate the images for their artistic or scientic legitimacy. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Jeyifous “challenged,” or disputed, an aspect of the images; rather, the focus of the text is on the inspiration behind the images and the method Jeyifous used to achieve them.

    optionB: "B. amplify",
    optionC: "C. overlook",
    optionD: "D. assemble",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of an exhibit at the Brooklyn Public Library. In this context, "overlook" means to ignore or to miss. The text states that artist and curator Joe Baker organized an exhibit that features Lenape beadwork in historical and modern works. The text describes the exhibit as "essential viewing," suggesting that it’s an important exhibit that people should make an effort to visit; this context conveys that it would be a mistake to overlook the exhibit. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "complicate" would mean to add diculty, and there’s no reason to think the text would need to directly caution against complicating Baker’s exhibit; the text focuses on the idea that the exhibit is "essential viewing," not on the idea of a potential diculty that could be raised. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, "amplify" means to increase, and there’s no reason to believe the text would indicate that it would be a mistake to increase an exhibit the text describes as "essential viewing." Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that it would be a mistake to "assemble," or put together, Baker’s exhibit: the text makes it clear that the exhibit has already been put together and, further, praises the exhibit as "essential viewing."',

    question:
      "Text 1 Some animal species, like the leopard, can be found in many kinds of areas. On the other hand, tropical mountain bird species tend to be limited in the types of spaces they can call home. This is because many mountain bird species are only able to survive at very specic elevations. Over time, these species have likely become used to living at a specic temperature. Therefore, these species struggle to survive at elevations that are warmer or colder than they are used to. Text 2 A new study reviewed observations of nearly 3,000 bird species to understand why tropical mountain bird species live at specic elevations. They noted that when a mountain bird species was found in an area with many other bird species, it tended to inhabit much smaller geographic areas. It is thus likely that competition for resources with other species, not temperature, limits where these birds can live. Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",

      "Part of the Atacama Desert in Peru has surprisingly rich plant life despite receiving almost no rainfall. Moisture from winter fog sustains plants once they’re growing, but the soil’s tough crust makes it hard for seeds to germinate in the rst place. Local birds that dig nests in the ground seem to be of help: they churn the soil, exposing buried seeds to moisture and nutrients. Indeed, in 2016 Cristina Rengifo Faiffer found that mounds of soil dug up by birds were far more fertile and supported more seedlings than soil in undisturbed areas. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",

    optionD:
      "D. It explains how certain birds promote seed germination in Atacama Desert soil.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The rst two sentences establish a natural phenomenon: there is a richness of plant life found in the Atacama Desert despite the hard soil that makes it challenging for seeds to germinate. The next sentence, which contains the underlined portion, offers a potential explanation for the phenomenon: local birds dig ground nests exposing seeds to moisture and materials in the soil necessary for germination. The last sentence summarizes a study that compared the fertileness of mounds of dirt dug up by birds to mounds that were undisturbed to support the explanation in the underlined portion. Thus, the underlined portion mainly functions to explain how certain birds promote seed germination in the Atacama Desert soil. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t address the topic of the soil’s tough crust or its formation. Instead, the text elaborates on the idea that local birds that build ground nests may help seeds germinate in the hard soil. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion describes how some birds may support seed germination in Atacama Desert soil but doesn’t describe how the seeds are deposited into the soil before germination begins. Choice C is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole identies a reason that a particular bird species may choose to dig ground nests in the Atacama Desert soil.",

    optionC: "C. Correct",
    optionD: "D. Particular",
    correctAnswer: 3,

      'Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, "specic" most nearly means particular. The text is referring to the particular view of the Port of Oakland as seen from a subway train as it rises from underground. This specic, or particular, view has always been special to Moss, a lifetime resident of West Oakland. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text itself is a work of ction, the view is something Moss can point out to his companions on the train, so the view itself is presumably not imaginary. Choice B is incorrect. Although this view of the Port of Oakland is signicant to Moss, nothing in the text describes the view as particularly energetic as opposed to calming, for example. Choice C is incorrect.

    optionB: "B. obvious",
    optionC: "C. accidental",
    optionD: "D. observable",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Bastos’s study of a wild kea parrot. In this context, "accidental" means unplanned or unintentional. The text rst describes Bastos’s study, which concerns a kea that is observed using small stones to preen its feathers. The text then mentions colleagues who are skeptical (that is, they have doubt) about Bastos’s ndings, and nally describes how Bastos and her team responded to the skepticism of those colleagues. Given that the colleagues mentioned in the text expressed skepticism regarding Bastos’s ndings, the best answer choice must be one that completes the text in a manner such that the skeptics’ opinion regarding the kea’s use of stones disagrees with that held by Bastos and her team. Since Bastos and her team showed that the kea’s use of stones was deliberate (that is, intentional), the skeptics’ opinion in this context must be that the kea’s use of stones was unintentional, or accidental. Choice A is incorrect because the best answer choice is one that portrays skepticism, or doubt, of Bastos’s claim that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate, or intentional. If the skeptics found the kea’s usage of stones "intriguing," or fascinating, this would not be at odds with the position of Bastos and her team; in fact, it is reasonable to believe that someone who agreed that the kea’s stone usage was deliberate would also nd it intriguing. Choice B is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea’s usage of small stones was "obvious," or evident, this would not be contrary to the observation of Bastos and her team that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate: in fact, these opinions would be consistent with each other. Choice D is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea’s usage of small stones was "observable," or visible, this would not conict with the claim of Bastos and her team that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate: instead, these positions would agree.',

      'Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to portray Francie’s determination to reach her goal of reading all the books in the world. The text indicates that to achieve this aim, Francie works systematically and persistently: she reads all the books in the library in alphabetical order and devotes much time and effort to the project, nishing one book per day over a long period of time. The text then suggests that even though she progresses slowly ("she was still in the B’s") and that she struggled with some books ("some of the B’s had been hard going"), she doesn’t give up because she thinks of herself as "a reader."

      "Text 1 Ecologists have long wondered how thousands of microscopic phytoplankton species can live together near ocean surfaces competing for the same resources. According to conventional wisdom, one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest. So why do so many species remain? Ecologists’ many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven’t uncovered a satisfactory explanation. Text 2 Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton’s diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld’s team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought. Based on the texts, how would Behrenfeld and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” discussed in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By arguing that it is based on a misconception about phytoplankton species competing with one another",
    optionB:
      "B. By asserting that it fails to recognize that routine replenishment of ocean nutrients prevents competition between phytoplankton species",

    optionD:
      "D. By recommending that more ecologists focus their research on how competition among phytoplankton species is increased with water density",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because based on Text 2, it represents how Behrenfeld and colleagues would most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” discussed in Text 1. The conventional wisdom cited holds the opinion that when there is species diversity within a phytoplankton population, “one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest”—that is, after being so successful in competing for resources that the other species vanish from the population. However, Text 2 explains that according to Behrenfeld and colleagues, phytoplankton are so small and spaced so far apart in the water that there is “much less” direct competition for resources within phytoplankton populations than scientists had previously thought. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses whether routine replenishment of ocean nutrients affects competition between phytoplankton species. Choice C is incorrect because the interspecies competition discussed in both texts is specically between phytoplankton species, and neither text considers whether phytoplankton compete for resources with larger nonphytoplankton species.

In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed benets of Alice’s plan is that it can be easily arranged. Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice’s plan can be arranged, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that it can be arranged “faintly,” or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little diculty. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “simply” can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word “hastily” indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice’s plan was made in haste, the text doesn’t focus on this aspect of her plan. Instead, the text focuses on the plan’s seemingly good qualities, saying that Alice thinks of it as “the best,” and the narrator refers to it as “excellent” and “neatly,” or eciently, arranged. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “simply” can mean foolishly, or lacking good sense, it doesn’t have this meaning in this context. Although the text says that Alice doesn’t know how to go about her plan, it begins by presenting her plan in a positive light: Alice describes her plan as “the best,” and the narrator refers to the plan as “excellent” and “neatly,” or eciently, arranged.",

    question:
      "The mimosa tree evolved in East Asia, where the beetle Bruchidius terrenus preys on its seeds. In 1785, mimosa trees were introduced to North America, far from any B. terrenus. But evolutionary links between predators and their prey can persist across centuries and continents. Around 2001, B. terrenus was introduced in southeastern North America near where botanist Shu-Mei Chang and colleagues had been monitoring mimosa trees. Within a year, 93 percent of the trees had been attacked by the beetles. Which choice best describes the function of the third sentence in the overall structure of the text?",

      "C. It provides context that claries why the species mentioned spread to new locations.",
    optionD:
      "D. It offers an alternative explanation for the ndings of Chang and colleagues.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the third sentence within the overall structure of the text. The third sentence makes a generalization, asserting that evolutionary links between predators and prey can persist across great expanses of time and distance. This generalization is exemplied by the text’s discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and B. terrenus beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no B. terrenus beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted. When the beetles were introduced to North America more than 200 years later, however, they quickly attacked mimosa trees, illustrating the generalization that links between predators and prey "can persist across centuries and continents." Choice A is incorrect because the third sentence doesn’t indicate that Chang and colleagues were investigating any hypothesis. According to the text, Chang and colleagues were simply monitoring mimosa trees when the beetles happened to be introduced to the area. Choice C is incorrect because the third sentence doesn’t discuss any particular species, let alone the species mentioned elsewhere in the text, nor does the sentence explain why species spread to new locations. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence offers a generalization about the relationship between predators and prey, not an explanation for the ndings by Chang and colleagues that’s an "alternative" to an explanation presented elsewhere in the text.',

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. exceed",
    optionB: "B. diminish",
    optionC: "C. encompass",
    optionD: "D. conceal",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of birdsong. In this context, "diminish" means reduce or lessen. The text establishes that birds sing to communicate over potentially large distances and that researchers believe that birds that live in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds that live in comparatively sparsely vegetated habitats. The text then explains that researchers hold this belief due to some effect of dense vegetation on the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. If birds sing to communicate over long distances, it would be logical to conclude that researchers believe that birds in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds in relatively sparse habitats do because dense vegetation diminishes the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that dense vegetation can "exceed," or surpass or go beyond, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel, not that dense vegetation goes farther than that distance. Choice C is incorrect because it would not be sensible to say that dense vegetation can "encompass," or enclose or encircle, the distance that highfrequency sounds can travel. The distance that sounds can travel is not an object that can be enclosed or encircled by vegetation. Choice D is incorrect because there is no information in the text indicating that dense vegetation can "conceal," or hide or keep from being observed, the distance that high-frequency sounds travel. Instead, the text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel.',

    optionB: "B. discounted",
    optionC: "C. redened",
    optionD: "D. exploited",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of using magnetism to detect stress in buried metal pipes. In this context, "exploited" means made productive use of. The text indicates that the magnetic elds of some metals change under stress and that Saleem and colleagues showed that it is possible to measure those changes from a distance, thereby demonstrating that the integrity of underground metal pipes can be evaluated without having to unearth them. This context thus indicates that Saleem and colleagues made productive use of, or exploited, this tendency of the metals’ magnetic elds. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "hypothesized" would mean made a tentative assumption to be evaluated in a study or experiment. Although Saleem and colleagues may have had one or more hypotheses for these experiments, the text presents the information about the tendency of some metals’ magnetic elds to change under stress as a known fact that the researchers made productive use of, not as a hypothesis to be evaluated. The text after the colon indicates that the researchers were not evaluating whether such changes occur but whether those changes can be measured at a distance. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "discounted" would mean downplayed or ignored, but the text does not suggest that Saleem and colleagues minimized or ignored the tendency of the magnetic elds of some metals to change under stress. Rather, the text indicates that this tendency is the basis for Saleem and colleagues’ method of assessing the pipes’ integrity. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text indicates that Saleem and colleagues "redened," or reevaluated or reformulated, the tendency of some metals’ magnetic elds to change under stress.

    optionB: "B. predetermined",
    optionC: "C. operative",
    optionD: "D. latent",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of baleen whale accessory spleens. In this context, “latent” means dormant or functionless. The text sets up a contrast between the idea that baleen whale accessory spleens appear not to have a function and the research indicating that the accessory spleen may actually have a role in supporting the whales’ diving mechanisms. This context therefore conveys the idea that the assumption that baleen whale accessory spleens are latent may be incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the role of the accessory spleen is “replicable,” or capable of being reproduced. The text indicates that the role of the accessory spleen seems to have no function, but some researchers think it does have a role; the text doesn’t address whether the role of the accessory spleen could or couldn’t be reproduced. Choice B is incorrect because suggesting that the role of the accessory spleen is “predetermined,” or decided in advance, wouldn’t make sense in context. Although the researchers may agree that the role of the accessory spleen or any other organ hasn’t been determined in advance, the text focuses on the idea that the accessory spleen was thought to have been functionless but may in fact serve an active role for baleen whales.

    optionA: "A. unobtrusive",
    optionB: "B. concealed",
    optionC: "C. approximate",
    optionD: "D. peripheral",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the location of the province of Xoconochco within the Aztec Empire. As used in this context, “peripheral” means situated toward the outer bounds rather than the center. The text indicates that Xoconochco was located on a coast, hundreds of kilometers away from the capital of the Aztec Empire. The text also states that trade between the province and the capital required “a long overland journey.” This context suggests that Xoconochco was situated toward an edge of the empire’s territory rather than near its center. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to refer to Xoconochco’s location within the Aztec Empire as “unobtrusive,” or not blatant or undesirably prominent; it’s not clear how a province’s physical location would or wouldn’t be blatant. Instead of focusing on how noticeable Xoconochco’s location was, the text emphasizes the province’s distance from the capital of the empire, pointing out that because of this distance trade between the two required “a long overland journey.” Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the province of Xoconochco was located on a coast far from the capital of the Aztec Empire, not that it was “concealed,” or kept out of sight or hidden from view. Nothing in the text suggests that Xoconochco was actually hidden such that people couldn’t see it, and being hidden wouldn’t necessarily result in trade between the province and the capital requiring “a long overland journey.” Choice C is incorrect because to say that Xoconochco’s location within the Aztec Empire was “approximate” would mean that the location either wasn’t precisely correct or was close to some other location. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text indicates that Xoconochco’s location is known and that it was far from the empire’s capital, so there’s no reason to characterize the location as either not precisely correct or close to another location.",

    optionA: "A. antecedent",
    optionB: "B. impending",
    optionC: "C. innocuous",
    optionD: "D. perpetual",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of advance indications of solar ares. In this context the word "impending" means imminent or approaching. The text mentions a study by Leka and colleagues that found that the Sun’s corona provides an advance indication of solar ares. The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful—solar ares can interfere with communications on Earth—and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar are. The text indicates that this characteristic—increased brightness in a particular region of the corona—comes before the appearance of the are. Therefore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the are is approaching, or impending. Choice A is incorrect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun’s corona precedes the appearance of the are. But if the are were "antecedent," or previous, then the are would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word "innocuous," or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar ares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorrect. If the solar ares have an advance indication of their appearance, then there must therefore be a time before the appearance of the ares when they do not exist. But the word "perpetual," or never-ending, would in context indicate that the are exists at the same time as the advance indication provided by the Sun’s corona, which would not make logical sense.',

More than 200 crude stone tools were found embedded in a layer of earth that is up to 33,150 years old, revealing that humans occupied the cave thousands of years before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2 The objects uncovered in Chiquihuite Cave are intriguing, but it is premature to characterize them as tools. The stone pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply fractured from rocks during natural geological activity in the cave. Moreover, their unearthing has thus far not been accompanied by discoveries of other signs of human activity or even traces of human DNA from surfaces. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?",

    optionD:
      "D. By pointing out that it fails to account for evidence that the Clovis people were active on the continent as early as is commonly thought",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim about the Clovis people in Text 1. Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clovis people were the rst human inhabitants of North America has been overturned by the unearthing of stone tools in Chiquihuite Cave in Mexico. The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old—much older than the Clovis people’s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are denitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces—that they are human-made tools—that is not suciently supported by available evidence. Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn’t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group’s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn’t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be conrmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group’s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent’s rst inhabitants. Therefore, there’s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought.",

      "Text 1 A team led by Bernardo Strassburg has found that rewilding farmland (returning the land to its natural state) could help preserve biodiversity and offset carbon emissions. The amount of farmland that would need to be restored, they found, is remarkably low. Rewilding a mere 15% of the world’s current farmland would prevent 60% of expected species extinctions and help absorb nearly 299 gigatons of carbon dioxide—a clear win in the ght against the biodiversity and climate crises. Text 2 While Strassburg’s team’s ndings certainly offer encouraging insight into the potential benets of rewilding, it’s important to consider potential effects on global food supplies. The researchers suggest that to compensate for the loss of food-producing land, remaining farmland would need to produce even more food.

Text 1 does present the 15% number as enough to achieve meaningful results, but that’s not what Text 2 takes issue with: rather, Text 2 argues that we need to consider the effect that rewilding this much farmland would have on food supplies. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t a difference between the two views. Neither text mentions the timeline for achieving the results described by Strassburg’s team. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t a difference between the two views. Text 1 focuses on rewilding’s effects on both carbon emissions and biodiversity. Text 2 doesn’t focus on rewilding’s effect on carbon emissions at all. Instead, it focuses on a third factor: global food supplies.',

    question:
      "Text 1 In 1954 George Balanchine choreographed a production of The Nutcracker, a ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It has since become a tradition for hundreds of dance companies in North America to stage The Nutcracker each year. But the show is stuck in the past, with an old-fashioned story and references, so it should no longer be produced. Ballet needs to create new traditions if it wants to stay relevant to contemporary audiences. Text 2 The Nutcracker is outdated, but it should be kept because it’s a holiday favorite and provides substantial income for some dance companies. Although it can be behind the times, there are creative ways to update the show. For example, Debbie Allen successfully modernized the story. Her show Hot Chocolate Nutcracker combines ballet, tap, hip-hop, and other styles, and it has been gaining in popularity since it opened in 2009. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By questioning the idea that the story of The Nutcracker is stuck in the past and by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an\nupdated version",
    optionB:
      "B. By agreeing that contemporary audiences have largely stopped going to see performances of The Nutcracker because it’s so old-fashioned",
    optionC:
      "C. By pointing out that most dance companies could increase their incomes by offering modernized versions of The Nutcracker",
    optionD:
      "D. By suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 begins by noting the success of The Nutcracker but then claims that the ballet is "stuck in the past" and should "no longer be produced." Text 2 begins by conceding that The Nutcracker is indeed outdated but argues that it should continue to be performed, states that the show can be updated to include more contemporary dance styles, and provides an example of one such modernized version, Hot Chocolate Nutcracker. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 advocates for using creative ways to update The Nutcracker and therefore wouldn’t respond to the underlined claim by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version. Choice B is incorrect because although the authors of both texts claim that The Nutcracker is outdated, neither text suggests that contemporary audiences have largely stopped attending productions of the show. On the contrary, Text 2 states that The Nutcracker is a holiday favorite and generates substantial income for some dance companies. Choice C is incorrect because although Text 2 provides an example of a contemporized version of The Nutcracker, the text doesn’t suggest that offering modernized versions is a way to increase income for most dance companies. Rather, the author of Text 2 suggests that offering modernized versions is a way to make the ballet discussed in Text 1 feel less outdated.',

    question:
      "Text 1 Dominique Potvin and colleagues captured ve Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) to test a new design for attaching tracking devices to birds. As the researchers tted each magpie with a tracker attached by a small harness, they noticed some magpies without trackers pecking at another magpie’s tracker until it broke off. The researchers suggest that this behavior could be evidence of magpies attempting to help another magpie without beneting themselves. Text 2 It can be tempting to think that animals are deliberately providing help when we see them removing trackers and other equipment from one another, especially when a species is known to exhibit other cooperative behaviors. At the same time, it can be dicult to exclude the possibility that individuals are simply interested in the equipment because of its novelty, curiously pawing or pecking at it until it detaches. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the researchers’ perspective in Text 1 on the behavior of the magpies without trackers?",
    optionA:
      "A. That behavior might have been due to the novelty of the magpies’ captive setting rather than to the novelty of the tracker.",
    optionB:
      "B. That behavior likely indicates that the magpies were deliberately attempting to benet themselves by obtaining the tracker.",
    optionC:
      "C. That behavior may not be evidence of selessness in Gymnorhina tibicen because not all the captured magpies demonstrated it.",
    optionD:
      "D. That behavior might be adequately explained without suggesting that the magpies were attempting to assist the other magpie.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the researchers’ perspective in Text 1 on the behavior of the magpies without trackers. According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benet to themselves. Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other. The text cautions that it shouldn’t be assumed that these animals are helping one another deliberately, since they might simply be pecking at trackers out of curiosity, causing them to fall off eventually. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues’ perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses the novelty, or the newness and unusual quality, of the captive settings in which animals have been observed to remove trackers from other animals, nor does it suggest that such novelty might account for this behavior. Instead, the text suggests that it’s the novelty of the tracking equipment itself that might cause the behavior: interested in the trackers because they’re unusual, animals might paw or peck at them until they fall off. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never suggests that when animals remove trackers from other animals, they do so because they wish to obtain the trackers for themselves. Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as seless only if all of them participate in it. Instead, the text argues that the behavior may not be seless at all and may instead be attributed to animals’ curiosity about the new and unusual trackers.",

      "The 1967 release of Harold Cruse’s book The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual isolated him from almost all other scholars and activists of the American Civil Rights Movement—though many of those thinkers disagreed with each other, he nonetheless found ways to disagree with them all. He thought that activists who believed that Black people such as himself should culturally assimilate were naïve. But he also sharply criticized Black nationalists such as Marcus Garvey who wanted to establish independent, self-contained Black economies and societies, even though Cruse himself identied as a Black nationalist. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?",
    optionA:
      "A. It describes a direction that Cruse felt the Civil Rights Movement ought to take.",

The underlined sentence describes one way that Cruse both did and didn’t t in with those thinkers: he criticized Black nationalists, even though he identied as one. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined sentence doesn’t do this. It describes Cruse’s criticisms—it never mentions what Cruse did want the movement to do instead. Choice B is incorrect. This conicts with the text, which argues that Cruse did disagree with almost all other scholars of the Civil Rights Movement. Choice C is incorrect. This is a step too far.

    question:
      "Text 1 Polar bears sustain themselves primarily by hunting seals on the Arctic sea ice, but rising ocean temperatures are causing the ice to diminish, raising concerns about polar bear population declines as these large predators’ seal-hunting habitats continue to shrink. A 2020 study examining polar bear populations across the Arctic concluded that populations affected by sea-ice loss are at great risk of extinction by the end of the twenty-rst century. Text 2 Monitoring carried out by researchers from the Norwegian Polar Institute shows that the polar bear population on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard remains stable and well nourished despite rapidly declining sea ice in recent years. The researchers attribute this population’s resilience in part to a shift in feeding strategies: in addition to hunting seals, the Svalbard polar bears have begun relying on a diet of reindeer meat and birds’ eggs. Based on the texts, how would the researchers in Text 2 most likely respond to the conclusion presented in the underlined portion of Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By noting that it neglects the possibility of some polar bear populations adapting to changes in their environment",
    optionB:
      "B. By suggesting that it is likely incorrect about the rates at which warming ocean temperatures have caused sea ice to melt in the Arctic",
    optionC:
      "C. By asserting that it overlooks polar bear populations that have not yet been affected by loss of seal-hunting habitats",
    optionD:
      "D. By arguing that it fails to account for polar bears’ reliance on a single seal-hunting strategy",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. Text 2 describes how the Svalbard polar bears have adapted to the loss of sea ice by diversifying their diet and feeding on reindeer and seabird eggs, resulting in a “stable and well nourished” population despite environmental challenges. This counters the underlined claim that polar bears facing a loss of sea ice are at “great risk of extinction” by the end of the century. Choice B is incorrect. Text 2 does not challenge the fact that sea ice is rapidly declining in the Arctic due to warming ocean temperatures. In fact, it states that the Svalbard polar bears have faced “rapidly declining sea ice in recent years.” Choice C is incorrect. The claim in Text 1 is specic to polar bear populations affected by the loss of seal hunting habitats, so unaffected populations are irrelevant to the claim. Also, Text 2 doesn’t mention any polar bear populations that haven’t yet been affected by loss of seal hunting habitats. It focuses on a population that has been affected by sea-ice loss but has managed to survive and thrive nevertheless. Choice D is incorrect. Text 2 doesn’t imply that polar bears rely on a single seal-hunting strategy. In fact, the researcher in Text 2 would say that Text 1 fails to account for polar bears’ ability to develop other hunting strategies and food sources.",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. derived from",
    optionB: "B. recognized in",
    optionC: "C. conned to",
    optionD: "D. repressed by",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of the artist Diego Velázquez’s inuence outside Spain. As used in this context, “conned to” means restricted to. The text says that Velázquez was the leading artist in the Spanish court during the seventeenth century, but it also notes that other painters around the world were inuenced by his techniques and style. Thus, Velázquez’s inuence was hardly (or almost not) conned to, or restricted to, Spain. Choice A is incorrect because if Velázquez was a leading artist in Spain, it doesn’t make logical sense to claim that his inuence was hardly (or almost not) derived from, or obtained from, Spain. Moreover, the other painters around the world who employed Velázquez’s techniques would by denition be inuenced by Spanish style. Choice B is incorrect because if Velázquez was a leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, then his inuence must have been widely recognized, or acknowledged, rather than being hardly (or almost not) recognized. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that deliberately limiting Velázquez’s inuence outside Spain was ever considered by anyone. Thus, even if it is true that his inuence was not repressed, or restrained, it doesn’t make logical sense to say so in this context.",

For instance, his waltz “Pleasant Moments” and his opera Treemonisha skillfully blend ragtime and classical music. These masterpieces deserve as much fame as Joplin’s biggest hits. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To describe the similarities and differences between ragtime music and opera",
    optionB:
      "B. To argue that more attention should be given to Joplin’s lesser-known works",

      "C. To encourage music lovers to listen to music by many different composers",
    optionD:
      "D. To explain how Joplin learned to compose and perform ragtime music",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is to make a case for the importance of Scott Joplin’s less famous works. The text begins by introducing Joplin’s most popular works and then goes on to assert that gaining a full understanding of Joplin’s creativity requires a consideration of his lesser-known pieces as well. The text concludes by characterizing the lesser-known works "Pleasant Moments" and Treemonisha as masterpieces that deserve to be famous. These details indicate that the text’s main purpose is to argue that more attention should be given to Joplin’s lesserknown works. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses some of the ragtime music and an opera that Joplin composed, it does not compare the two types of music in general. Instead, the text argues that Joplin’s lesser-known works, including his opera, deserve as much attention as his more famous ragtime pieces receive. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses only Joplin’s music and does not ask music lovers to listen to a variety of composers. Instead, the text encourages listeners to pay attention to Joplin’s lesser-known works in order to gain a full understanding of his creativity. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not discuss how Joplin learned to compose and perform ragtime music.

So, before sleeping, Latro records the important experiences of each day on a scroll, carefully choosing which ones to ______. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. suspect",
    optionB: "B. preserve",
    optionC: "C. suggest",
    optionD: "D. imagine",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text about Latro, the main character in Gene Wolfe’s novel Soldier of the Mist. In this context, "preserve" means save or keep from destruction or loss. The text describes Latro as a character who loses his memory whenever he sleeps. The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them. The context therefore supports the idea that Latro records his most important experiences in an effort to save, or preserve, his memory of them from loss. Choice A is incorrect because "suspect" would mean mistrust, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "suggest" would mean propose for consideration. The text emphasizes the fact that Latro actually records those experiences that he has decided are most important to him, not that he merely proposes which experiences to consider for inclusion in his scroll. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "imagine" would either mean form a mental image of or fabricate, neither of which would logically complete the text. Although it’s possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down. In a similar vein, the text emphasizes that Latro is recording experiences that have actually happened to him, not that he’s fabricating the experiences he records.',

    optionB: "B. Combined",
    optionC: "C. Remembered",
    optionD: "D. Celebrated",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, "mingled" most nearly means combined. In the text, the speaker refers to several concepts mingling together and then compares this to "the blending of" two other things (an exotic plant and the fragrance of a strange ower). This comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts of love, April, and the gold of someone’s hair as being blended together, or combined. Choice A is incorrect because "mingled" means combined, not identied. The speaker names several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) and then moves to a comparison of their mingling together to "the blending of" a plant and the scent of a ower, conveying the idea that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined. Choice C is incorrect. The text as a whole may refer to a memory, but the comparison of the mingling of several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) to "the blending of" a plant and the scent of a ower conveys that the speaker views those concepts as actually blended together, or combined, and not simply remembered at the same time. Choice D is incorrect.

She then states that she rehearses "the small world’s scheme"—that is, imagines moving through her mental map—and challenges herself to use the map in her mind while lying in bed at night. The underlined portion presents two such challenges (getting to the store through backyards and traveling from school to a friend’s house) and thus provides examples of what the narrator thinks about at night.

    optionB: "B. satisfactory",
    optionC: "C. negligible",
    optionD: "D. commonplace",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the study of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. In this context, “negligible” means not signicant enough to be worth considering. The text says that the study challenged the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. The text goes on to say that the researchers found that “in fact, as many as half” the hunters in the groups studied were female. The phrase “in fact” establishes a contrast indicating that the nding that as many as half the hunters were female differs from the accepted view. This context suggests, then, that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was negligible. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among prehistoric peoples were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was “inevitable,” or unavoidable. Nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view is that prehistoric peoples could not avoid female participation in hunting. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples is that such participation was “satisfactory,” or sucient to meet a requirement or demand. There is no information in the text about any demands or requirements regarding female participation in hunting, let alone any information about how much female participation in hunting would be enough to satisfy those demands or requirements. Instead, the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half the hunters in the groups studied were female, suggesting that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was low. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among the prehistoric peoples studied were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was “commonplace,” or ordinary or unremarkable.

    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of bronze- and brass-casting techniques used by the Igun Eronmwon guild. In this context “adhere to” would mean to act in accordance with. The text states that although members of the Igun Eronmwon guild typically do something with techniques that have been passed down since the thirteenth century, they “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” By establishing a contrast with not always following traditions, the context suggests that guild members do typically adhere to traditional techniques. Choice A is incorrect because in this context “experiment with” would mean to do something new with. Although using motors rather than manual bellows is presented as a new approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” The phrase “experiment with” wouldn’t support the contrast because regularly trying new things with the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions.

Although using motors rather than manual bellows might be an improved approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” The phrase “improve on” wouldn’t support the contrast because regularly making changes to the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions.

    optionB: "B. required",
    optionC: "C. unintended",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ronyoung Kim’s novel Clay Walls. In this context, "distinct" means clearly separate and different. The text indicates that the novel consists of three sections and that each section is narrated from the perspective of a different character. This context supports the idea that Kim’s novel features three distinct perspectives. Choice B is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as "required," or demanded as necessary to be done or provided, wouldn’t make sense in context. When writing a novel, a novelist is free to choose to narrate the story from any number of perspectives. There’s nothing in the text to indicate that providing three perspectives was demanded of Kim. Instead, the text focuses on identifying the three different perspectives featured in Kim’s novel. Choice C is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as "unintended," or not planned as a purpose or goal, wouldn’t make sense in context. Authors make deliberate choices about the perspectives they feature in their works, and the text indicates that Kim chose to incorporate three different perspectives in her novel. Choice D is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as "unknown," or not revealed, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text directly identies the three perspectives that appear in her novel as those of Faye and her two parents, Haesu and Chun, which indicates that the novel’s perspectives are in fact known.',
