    question:
      "“Poetry” is a 1919 poem by Marianne Moore. The poem highlights an ambivalence toward poetry as the speaker acknowledges its merits while also expressing a sense of displeasure, writing ______ Which quotation from “Poetry” most effectively illustrates the claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. “nor is it valid / to discriminate against ‘business documents and / school-books’; all these phenomena are important.”",
    optionB:
      "B. “One must make a distinction / however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not / poetry”",
    optionC:
      "C. “when [poems] become so derivative as to become unintelligible, the / same thing may be said for all of us—that we / do not admire what / we cannot\nunderstan",
    optionD:
      "D. “Reading [poetry], however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers that there is in / it after all, a place for the genuine.”",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from "Poetry" to illustrate the claim that the poem highlights an ambivalence, or a conicted attitude, toward poetry. In the quotation, the speaker suggests that one might read poetry with "contempt," or disdain, for it, but even with this negative attitude one will nd "a place for the genuine." Because the quotation expresses conicting attitudes toward poetry, it effectively illustrates the speaker’s ambivalence in discussing the merits and displeasure of reading poetry. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn’t mention poetry or show ambivalence. Choice B is incorrect. Although the idea of "half poets" may seem to relate to ambivalence, the speaker mentions only negative attitudes toward certain works and the quotation therefore lacks a contrasting positive or neutral attitude that would be needed to indicate ambivalence. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker mentions only negative attitudes toward certain works and the quotation therefore lacks a contrasting positive or neutral attitude that would be needed to indicate ambivalence.',

      "Oluwaseyi Moejoh cofounded U-recycle Initiative Africa when she was only a teenager. Moejoh and her team founded the organization to teach young people how their actions affect the environment and why recycling is important. For example, the organization put on an exhibit of art made using recycled materials. According to the text, what is one reason Moejoh and others founded U-recycle Initiative Africa?",
    optionA: "A. To bring attention to overlooked African artists",
    optionB: "B. To teach young people why recycling is important",
    optionC: "C. To help adults gain important outdoor skills",
    optionD: "D. To give teenagers advice about starting businesses",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it describes a reason that Moejoh and team founded U-recycle Initiative Africa. The text mentions two reasons the initiative was founded: to teach young people about how they affect the environment and to teach them “why recycling is important.” Thus, teaching the importance of recycling to young people accurately describes a motivation that the text cites as a reason for the initiative’s founding. Choice A is incorrect. Although art is mentioned in the text, there are no details about artists or whether they are being overlooked. Choice C is incorrect because the text is explicitly about young people and their relationship to the environment and recycling. There is no mention of adults or outdoor skills. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses young people, which likely includes teenagers, there is no mention of starting businesses.",

    optionA: "A. the cold-dry season for both females and males.",
    optionB:
      "B. the cold-dry season for females and the hot-dry season for males.",
    optionC:
      "C. the hot-dry season for females and the monsoon season for males.",
    optionD: "D. the monsoon season for both females and males.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. Females only traveled 9.28 km per day in the cold-dry season, versus 12.64 and 12.48 km per day in the monsoon and hot-dry seasons, respectively. Males only traveled 15.81 km per day per day in the cold-dry season, versus 18.93 and 18.87 km per day in the monsoon and hot-dry seasons, respectively. So, the cold-dry season was the season where both males and females had the least daily travel. Choice B is incorrect. Although females traveled least in the cold-dry season, males didn’t travel least in the hot-dry season. Instead, they traveled less per day in the cold-dry season as well. Choice C is incorrect. Females had less daily travel in the cold-dry season than in the hot-dry season (9.28 versus 12.48 km per day), and males had less daily travel in the cold-dry season than in the monsoon season (15.81 versus 18.93 km per day). Choice D is incorrect. In fact, both females and males traveled the most kilometers per day in the monsoon season.",

    question:
      "A student performs an experiment testing her hypothesis that a slightly acidic soil environment is more benecial for the growth of the plant Brassica rapa parachinensis (a vegetable commonly known as choy sum) than a neutral soil environment. She plants sixteen seeds of choy sum in a mixture of equal amounts of coffee grounds (which are highly acidic) and potting soil and another sixteen seeds in potting soil without coffee grounds as the control for the experiment. The two groups of seeds were exposed to the same growing conditions and monitored for three weeks. Which nding, if true, would most directly weaken the student’s hypothesis?",
    optionA:
      "A. The choy sum planted in the soil without coffee grounds were signicantly taller at the end of the experiment than the choy sum planted in the mixture of soil\nand coffee grounds.",
    optionB:
      "B. The choy sum grown in the soil without coffee grounds weighed signicantly less at the end of the experiment than the choy sum grown in the mixture of soil\nand coffee grounds.",
    optionC:
      "C. The choy sum seeds planted in the soil without coffee grounds sprouted signicantly later in the experiment than did the seeds planted in the mixture of soil\nand coffee grounds.",
    optionD:
      "D. Signicantly fewer of the choy sum seeds planted in the soil without coffee grounds sprouted plants than did the seeds planted in the mixture of soil and coffee\ngrounds.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it describes an experimental outcome that would most directly weaken the student’s hypothesis. According to the text, the student hypothesizes that Brassica rapa parachinensis (choy sum) will benet more from acidic soil than it will from neutral soil. The text then explains that the student planted 16 choy sum seeds in potting soil with coffee grounds added to increase acidity and another 16 seeds in soil without coffee grounds as a control (a group identical to the experimental group except for the experimental modication being tested). If the hypothesis were correct, the plants in the more acidic soiland-coffee-grounds mixture would grow faster than those in the control group. However, choice A proposes a scenario in which the plants in soil without coffee grounds were “signicantly taller” than those in the more acidic mixture—an outcome that weakens the hypothesis that higher acidity is benecial to the plants’ growth. Choice B is incorrect. If the choy sum planted in the neutral soil produced less plant matter and therefore weighed less than the choy sum planted in the acidic soiland-coffee-grounds mixture, this nding would strengthen the student’s hypothesis, not weaken it. Choice C is incorrect. If seeds planted in neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted signicantly later than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture, this nding would strengthen, not weaken, the student’s hypothesis that acidic soil benets choy sum. Choice D is incorrect. If seeds planted in the neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted signicantly fewer plants than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture did, this nding would strengthen, not weaken, the student’s hypothesis that choy sum benets from acidic soil.",

    question:
      "Initially observed in 2017, the interstellar object ‘Oumuamua is the rst object of its kind to be seen in our solar system. Researchers have been puzzled because its acceleration cannot be entirely explained by the gravitational pull of nearby bodies: there must be a nongravitational inuence on its velocity and trajectory. Some previously suggested explanations for this nongravitational acceleration involve mechanisms that are unlikely or unrealistic, such as geometric effects from ‘Oumuamua being potentially composed of several spatially separated bodies. Now, Jennifer Bergner and colleagues propose that the nongravitational acceleration is due to the gaseous expulsion of entrapped hydrogen from ‘Oumuamua’s water-rich icy body. Which statement, if true, would most strongly support the claim made by Bergner and colleagues about the cause of ‘Oumuamua’s acceleration?",
    optionA: "A. ",
    optionB:
      "B. ‘Oumuamua’s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration that would be caused by the release of hydrogen gas resulting from the processing\nof water ice (H O), but the interstellar object’s observable properties can be explained if it has a signicant component of molecular hydrogen ice (H ).",
    optionC:
      "C. Since nongravitational accelerations of interstellar objects are several orders of magnitude weaker than gravitational accelerations, deviation from behavior that\ncould be fully attributed to gravitational pull has been detected on a limited number of objects similar to ‘Oumuamu",
    optionD:
      "D. Exposure to interstellar cosmic radiation can result in the formation of embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice; moreover, when traveling through the\nsolar system, ‘Oumuamua experienced warming sucient to alter its icy structure and allow for outgassing.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents ndings that, if true, would support the claim made by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of ‘Oumuamua is due to the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen. The text rst introduces the observation of a unique interstellar object named ‘Oumuamua and goes on to explain that the object exhibited nongravitational acceleration that could not be fully attributed to the expected cause: gravitational pull of nearby celestial bodies. The text concludes by stating that Bergner and colleagues claim that the nongravitational acceleration is caused by expulsion of hydrogen gas from ‘Oumuamua’s water-rich icy body. To support this claim requires evidence that hydrogen gas could be present within ‘Oumuamua at all, which this answer choice presents: cosmic radiation can result in embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice. Additionally, evidence that this gas can be released from such a body is required to fully support the claim, which this answer choice goes on to provide: ‘Oumuamua experienced sucient warming as it traveled through the solar system to alter its icy structure and release the hydrogen gas. Thus, this answer choice provides the best evidence to support Bergner and colleagues’ claim. Choice A is incorrect because this answer choice concerns faults with previous models of outgassing from ‘Oumuamua of carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which would not support a claim regarding hydrogen outgassing. Furthermore, inconsistencies in other models would not provide evidence in support of a different model or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. The evidence presented in this answer choice would weaken the claim proposed by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of ‘Oumuamua is caused by the expulsion of hydrogen gas because this answer choice suggests that there is evidence that refutes this claim: ‘Oumuamua’s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration caused by the release of hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the remaining portion of this answer choice is unrelated to the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the claim being made by Bergner and colleagues concerns the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen gas, but this answer choice is concerned solely with the differences in magnitude of gravitational and nongravitational acceleration, which would not support Bergner’s claim. Furthermore, this answer choice discusses interstellar objects similar to ‘Oumuamua, but the text states that ‘Oumuamua is the rst observed object of its kind in our solar system, so evidence from other, similar bodies would not be available.",

    question:
      "The ice melted on a Norwegian mountain during a particularly warm summer in 2019, revealing a 1,700-year-old sandal to a mountaineer looking for artifacts. The sandal would normally have degraded quickly, but it was instead well preserved for centuries by the surrounding ice. According to archaeologist Espen Finstad and his team, the sandal, like those worn by imperial Romans, wouldn’t have offered any protection from the cold in the mountains, so some kind of insulation, like fabric or animal skin, would have needed to be worn on the feet with the sandal. What does the text indicate about the discovery of the sandal?",
    optionA:

    question:
      "Alice Guy-Blaché directed hundreds of lms between 1896 and 1920. She wanted audiences to feel like they were watching real people on screen. She would encourage actors in her lms to behave naturally. Guy-Blaché even hung a large sign reading “Be Natural” in the studio where she made her lms. At the time, lms lacked sound, so actors needed to rely solely on their bodies and facial expressions to convey emotions. As a result, actors tended to highly exaggerate their actions and expressions. The style of acting in Guy-Blaché’s lms was therefore ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA: "A. copied by many of Guy-Blaché’s peers.",
    optionB: "B. familiar to actors who had worked on other directors’ lms.",
    optionC: "C. very unusual for the perio",
    optionD: "D. better than lm acting today.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. The text tells us that “actors tended to highly exaggerate their actions and expressions” in lms produced from 1896 to 1920. This suggests that the natural style of acting in Guy-Blaché’s lms was very unusual for the time. Choice A is incorrect. The text never discusses any other directors copying the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché’s lms, and in fact suggests the opposite—that it was unusual for directors to suggest this style of acting at the time. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses actors’ familiarity with the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché’s lms, so there isn’t much basis for this inference. But since the text tells us that other lms of the period used a highly exaggerated form of acting, we might predict that the natural style in Guy-Blachés lms would have been unfamiliar to these actors.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of volunteering. The text asserts that volunteering benets both the community in which one volunteers and society as a whole. It then states that in a survey of young people, a majority of respondents said that volunteering helps individuals, but only 6% of respondents said that volunteering helps society as a whole. If volunteering does in fact help society as a whole, as the text says, but only 6% of young people believe it does, then it’s reasonable to conclude that volunteering is more helpful than many young people think it is. Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses young people’s beliefs about the benets of volunteering, not where young people believe they are able to volunteer. Nothing in the text suggests that many young people believe they are only able to volunteer in their own communities. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that volunteering is benecial for society as a whole, nothing in the text suggests that volunteering can benet society more than it can benet individual people. The text doesn’t compare the benets to society with the benets to individuals.

Ibáñez and colleagues modeled the radial growth of the trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate scenarios (the current climate, moderate change, and extreme change).

    optionD:
      "D. Growth with nitrogen under moderate change exceeded growth without nitrogen under the current climate, but the latter exceeded growth with nitrogen under\nextreme change.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Ibáñez and colleagues’ conclusion that increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition can compensate for the negative effect of climate change on tree growth if that change is moderate but not if it’s extreme. The bar graph shows the growth of sugar maple trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate-change scenarios: current conditions, a moderate change, and an extreme change. According to the graph, radial growth without nitrogen fertilization is projected to be about 0.16 centimeters (cm) under current conditions, 0.15 cm under a moderate change, and 0.04 cm under an extreme change. The graph also shows that with nitrogen fertilization, growth is projected to be about 0.18 centimeters under a moderate change but only about 0.06 centimeters under an extreme change. Thus, the data in the graph support the researchers’ conclusion by showing greater growth for a moderate change using nitrogen fertilization than they do either under current conditions without nitrogen fertilization or under an extreme change with nitrogen fertilization. Choice A is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn’t support Ibáñez and colleagues’ conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of anthropogenic nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it’s extreme. To support this would require comparing radial growth without nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under both moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth with nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions and moderate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under an extreme change, which don’t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice B is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn’t support Ibáñez and colleagues’ conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it’s extreme. The support needed would compare radial growth under current climate conditions without nitrogen fertilization to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth without nitrogen fertilization under current conditions and moderate change and growth with nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don’t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice C is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn’t support Ibáñez and colleagues’ conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it’s extreme. The support needed would compare radial growth without adding nitrogen under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only the growth with and without nitrogen fertilization under moderate climate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don’t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change.",

      "Juvenile Plants Found Growing on Bare Ground and in Patches of Vegetation for Five Species Species Bare ground Patches of vegetation Total Percent found in patches of vegetation T. moroderi 9 13 22 59.1% T. libanitis 83 120 203 59.1% H. syriacim 95 106 201 52.7% H. squamatum 218 321 539 59.6% H. stoechas 11 12 23 52.2% Alicia Montesinos-Navarro, Isabelle Storer, and Rocío Perez-Barrales recently examined several plots within a diverse plant community in southeast Spain. The researchers calculated that if individual plants were randomly distributed on this particular landscape, only about 15% would be with other plants in patches of vegetation. They counted the number of juvenile plants of ve species growing in patches of vegetation and the number growing alone on bare ground and compared those numbers to what would be expected if the plants were randomly distributed. Based on these results, they claim that plants of these species that grow in close proximity to other plants gain an advantage at an early developmental stage. Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researchers’ claim?",

    optionD:
      "D. Assessment\nSAT\nTest\nReading and Writing\nDomain\nInformation and\nIdeas\nSkill\nCommand of\nEvidence\nDiculty",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. The table shows the total number of juvenile plants from ve species that were found growing on bare ground and in patches of vegetation as well as the percentage of the total number of each species that were growing in patches of vegetation. For each of the ve species, more than 50% of the juvenile plants were growing in patches of vegetation. The text notes, however, that a random distribution of plants across the landscape should result in only about 15% of the plants being found in patches of vegetation. In other words, for each of the ve species, the percentage of juvenile plants found growing in patches of vegetation was substantially higher than could be explained by chance alone. This nding supports the claim in the text: if plants growing in patches are overrepresented among plants that have survived to the juvenile stage, as the data show they are, then it suggests that it’s advantageous for plants at an early stage of development to grow in patches of vegetation. Choice A is incorrect because the statement that less than 75% of juvenile plants were found growing in patches of vegetation, while true, doesn’t clearly support the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. Saying that less than 75% of plants were found in patches doesn’t indicate how the percentage growing in patches compares with the percentage that would be expected to grow in patches on the basis of chance alone, which is the information necessary to evaluate whether the claim in the text has support in the table. Put another way, if the percentage of plants found growing in patches was 15% or less, it would be true that less than 75% were found in patches, but the data would in fact weaken the claim in the text, not strengthen it, since the data would show that growing in patches wasn’t advantageous. Choice B is incorrect because only 12 plants of this species were found growing in patches, which was the lowest number of any species, not the greatest number. Additionally, even if it were true that this species had the greatest number of plants growing in patches, the nding would be irrelevant to the claim that plants of all ve species gained an advantage by growing in close proximity to other plants. Choice C is incorrect because 59.1% of the plants of these species were found growing in patches, which is a far greater percentage, not a lower percentage, than what would be expected if plants were randomly distributed (around 15%). Additionally, if it were true that the percentage of plants growing in patches was lower for these species than what would be expected from chance alone, that nding would weaken, not strengthen, the claim that growing in patches is advantageous.",

      "Zines are small-scale, self-printed magazines. They have been around since the Black literary zine Fire!! was created in the 1920s. Since then, zines have appealed to creators looking for an inexpensive form of expression to share with a select audience. Zine creators often mix art with social commentary and challenge mainstream culture. At rst, the internet appeared to replace the zine, but this old form persists. Today, there are enough zines in the United States to support annual zine festivals. This suggests that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA: "A. creators can reach a larger audience by posting online.",
    optionB: "B. zines are still a meaningful form of expression.",
    optionC: "C. creators can continue to explore new art forms.",
    optionD: "D. zines are good sources of mainstream culture.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically follows from the text’s point about zines today. The text describes zines as a form of expression that goes back to the 1920s and asserts that "this old form persists." The text then indicates that multiple zines exist in the US today and that they are popular enough to support annual festivals, a point that suggests that people continue to view zines as a meaningful form of expression. Choice A is incorrect because the text’s point about current interest in zines in the US doesn’t logically suggest that zine creators can reach a larger audience by posting online. The text indicates that zines have long had an audience, and there’s no indication that online posts have caused that audience to grow; there’s no mention of zine creators’ use of the internet at all. Choice C is incorrect because the idea that zine creators can explore new art forms—while objectively true—isn’t logically connected to the text’s discussion of zines as an existing form of expression (one that often includes art) or the point that zines are still popular enough in the US to support annual festivals. Choice D is incorrect because the point that zines are popular enough in the US today to support annual festivals doesn’t logically suggest that zines present mainstream culture (or are themselves mainstream); moreover, the text states that zine creators often "challenge mainstream culture."',

      "To create the poems in her 2017 collection One Last Word, poet Nikki Grimes used a writing method called the golden shovel. This method often involves choosing a line from an existing poem and then using each word from that line as the last word of each line in a new poem. Grimes wanted the poems in One Last Word to honor important Black poets of the past, so she chose lines by poets such as Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson. Writing in this way can be challenging and might seem as though it would produce awkward poems. However, reviewers praised One Last Word as a beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it. This reaction suggests that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. most reviewers didn’t understand Grimes’s goal for One Last Wor",
    optionB:
      "B. Grimes successfully used the golden shovel method to achieve her goal for One Last Wor",
    optionC:
      "C. Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson are two of Grimes’s favorite poets.",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Nikki Grimes’s poetry collection One Last Word. The text explains that Grimes used a writing method called the golden shovel to create the poems in her book. According to the text, the method involves basing a new poem on a line from an existing poem. The text then mentions Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson as examples of important Black poets whose lines of poetry form the basis of Grimes’s poems. The text goes on to say that this writing method is dicult and that the resulting poems can be awkward, but reviewers have positively reviewed Grimes’s book. If the reviewers of One Last Word specically note that the work is a “beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it,” then they must have appreciated how Grimes used the golden shovel method to pay tribute to other poets. This suggests that Grimes was successful in using the golden shovel method to achieve her goal of honoring Black poets in her book. Choice A is incorrect because the reaction suggests that most reviewers did understand Grimes’s goal for her book. According to the text, the reviewers noted that the poems in her book were a “beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it.” Earlier, the text claims that Grimes intended the poems “to honor important Black poets of the past,” so in their praise of her book, the reviewers clearly indicated that they understood Grimes’s goal. Choice C is incorrect. Although it’s likely that Grimes sought to honor Hughes and Johnson in her book of poetry because they’re among her favorite poets, this fact isn’t suggested by the reviewers’ positive reaction to her book. Instead, the reaction suggests that Grimes was successful in her use of the golden shovel method. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss whether other writers were inspired by Grimes to use the golden shovel method in their poetry. The text mentions the poets Hughes and Johnson as examples of poets honored in Grimes’s book and describes reviewers’ positive reception of her book, but it doesn’t detail Grimes’s impact on other writers.",

    question:
      "Although most songbirds build open, cupped nests, some species build domed nests with roofs that provide much more protection. Many ecologists have assumed that domed nests would provide protection from weather conditions and thus would allow species that build them to have larger geographic ranges than species that build open nests do. To evaluate this assumption, a research team led by evolutionary biologist Iliana Medina analyzed data for over 3,000 species of songbirds. Which nding from Medina and her colleagues’ study, if true, would most directly challenge the assumption in the underlined sentence?",
    optionA:
      "A. Species that build open nests tend to have higher extinction rates than species that build domed nests.",
    optionB:
      "B. Species that build open nests tend to be smaller in size than species that build domed nests.",
    optionC:
      "C. Species that build open nests tend to use fewer materials to build their nests than species that build domed nests do.",
    optionD:
      "D. Species that build open nests tend to have larger ranges than species that build domed nests.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would challenge the assumption that many ecologists have made about the connection between the building of domed nests and geographic range in songbirds. The text says that many ecologists have assumed that since domed nests provide protection from weather conditions, songbird species that build such nests should be able to have larger geographic ranges than songbird species that build open nests do. If Medina and her colleagues found that species that build open nests tend to have larger geographic ranges than species that build domed nests do, their nding would show the opposite of what the ecologists have assumed. It would therefore challenge the ecologists’ assumption. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there’s a relationship between songbird species’ extinction rates and their geographic ranges. The nding that species that build open nests tend to have higher extinction rates than species that build domed nests do would therefore have no clear bearing on the ecologists’ assumption that domed nests allow species that build them to have larger geographic ranges than those of species that build open nests. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there’s a relationship between songbird species’ sizes and their geographic ranges. The nding that species that build open nests tend to be smaller in size than species that build domed nests are would therefore have no clear bearing on the ecologists’ assumption that domed nests allow species that build them to have larger geographic ranges than those of species that build open nests. Choice C is incorrect because although the text indicates that many ecologists have assumed that there’s a connection between how songbird species build their nests and the species’ geographic ranges, the text says that this assumption is based on the shape of the nests—that is, whether the nests are domed or open—not the number of materials used. The nding that species that build open nests tend to use fewer materials to build their nests than species that build domed nests do would therefore have no clear bearing on the ecologists’ assumption that domed nests allow species that build them to have larger geographic ranges than those of species that build open nests.",

    optionD:
      "D. the craters found in the Arabia Terra region were necessarily created by events other than volcanic eruptions.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the Arabia Terra region of Mars. According to the text, there are craters in Arabia Terra that could be the result of volcanic activity, and researchers have found evidence of ash deposits consistent with a large eruption. The text goes on to note, however, that erosion and other events could have altered the surface of Mars. This observation suggests that current conditions on Mars’s surface are not necessarily a reliable guide to past events—some signs of past events could have been transformed or erased entirely—and thus the current makeup of Arabia Terra may not accurately reect past volcanic activity. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests only that past events could have changed Mars’s surface such that its current appearance isn’t a reliable guide to past activity, not that it’s likely that past eruptions were not as massive as astronomers previously believed. Nothing in the text supports a conclusion about the likely size of past eruptions. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that resurfacing events could have changed the appearance of Mars doesn’t imply that the ash discussed in the text likely came from multiple volcanoes. Although it’s possible that the ash came from different volcanoes, there’s no information in the text supporting a conclusion about how likely that possibility is. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Arabia Terra craters had to have been created by something other than volcanic eruptions. Although the text does suggest that the evidence consistent with volcanic eruptions shouldn’t be taken as denitive proof of past eruptions, that doesn’t mean that the craters couldn’t have been created by eruptions, only that we can’t be certain they were.",

    optionD: "D. were able to store extra crops for later use.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of Sumerian civilization and crop growth. The text mentions the hot, sunny weather in the area where the Sumerians lived, which made crops grow quickly but also made it dicult to keep them alive. The Sumerians solved this problem by using river water for their farming—as a result, they often harvested more crops than were needed in a season. It follows that the Sumerians must have needed to nd something to do with the surplus crops—that is, they stored the extra crops for later use. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn’t logically follow that a surplus in crops would lead the Sumerians to choose only certain days of the season to harvest. Nor is there any indication in the text that the Sumerians improved their farming methods with the goal of reducing the time spent farming. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the Sumerians tried to shield their crops from the sun: in fact, the text indicates that the sunny weather helped crops grow very quickly and that the Sumerians used river water to allow crops to be exposed to the sun without dying. Choice C is incorrect. Having a surplus of crops wouldn’t have caused the Sumerians to begin farming until long after 4000 BCE: in fact, since the text indicates that the Sumerian civilization formed around 4000 BCE and farming was a part of that civilization, the statement that Sumerians only began farming long after 4000 BCE isn’t supported by the text.",

Furthermore, it indicates that notes in the collection attest that some of these poems predate the Spanish invasion, while some customs depicted are likely Spanish in origin. The implication is that some poems were composed before the invasion but the references to Spanish customs could have come about only after the invasion, and thus that the collection includes content that predates the invasion and also content from after the invasion.

According to the table this species would be the saber-toothed cat, which became extinct 11,000 years before present. Choice A is incorrect because it compares the time since the extinction of the passenger pigeon to the time since the extinction of the huia instead of citing the species listed in the table that has been extinct the longest (the saber-toothed cat). The text indicates that the longer a species has been extinct, the lower the chances are that a suitable habitat exists for it today. Neither the table nor the text supports the claim that the passenger pigeon is especially vulnerable to this problem. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that the longer a species has been extinct, the less likely it is that there would be a suitable habitat available for the species today. So, the problem would be especially concerning for the saber-toothed cat, which became extinct several thousand years before the woolly mammoth did—not the other way around. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that the longer a species has been extinct, the lower the chances are that a suitable habitat would be available for that species today. According to the table, the Caribbean monk seal became extinct in 1952, which is the most recent extinction listed for a candidate species in the table.",

    question:
      "“Gestures” in painting are typically thought of as bold, expressive brushstrokes. In the 1970s, American painter Jack Whitten built a 12-foot (3.7-meter) tool he named the “developer” to apply paint to an entire canvas in one motion, resulting in his series of “slab” paintings from that decade. Whitten described this process as making an entire painting in “one gesture,” signaling a clear departure from the prevalence of gestures in his work from the 1960s. Some art historians claim this shift represents “removing gesture” from the process. Therefore, regardless of whether using the developer constitutes a gesture, both Whitten and these art historians likely agree that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. any tool that a painter uses to create an artwork is capable of creating gestures.",
    optionB:
      "B. Whitten’s work from the 1960s exhibits many more gestures than his work from the 1970s does.",
    optionC:
      "C. Whitten became less interested in exploring the role of gesture in his work as his career progresse",
    optionD:
      "D. Whitten’s work from the 1960s is much more realistic than his work from the 1970s is.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. Whitten thinks the tool made “one gesture” paintings, while historians think the tool “removed gesture” from the process completely. But putting that debate aside, both Whitten and the historians would agree that the paintings he made with the tool in the ’70s have way fewer gestures than his paintings from the ’60s, in which gestures are “prevalent,” meaning widely and extensively present. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text only discusses the “developer”—it never mentions other tools. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. If anything, the text suggests the opposite: that Whitten became more interested in exploring the role of gesture in his work as his career progressed, as his earlier paintings had many gestures, and his ’70s paintings only had “one gesture.” Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses the “realism” of Whitten’s art.",

    question:
      "In dialects of English spoken in Scotland, the “r” sound is strongly emphasized when it appears at the end of syllables (as in “car”) or before other consonant sounds (as in “bird”). English dialects of the Upland South, a region stretching from Oklahoma to western Virginia, place similar emphasis on “r” at the ends of syllables and before other consonant sounds. Historical records show that the Upland South was colonized largely by people whose ancestors came from Scotland. Thus, linguists have concluded that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. the English dialects spoken in the Upland South acquired their emphasis on the “r” sound from dialects spoken in Scotlan",
    optionB:
      "B. emphasis on the “r” sound will eventually spread from English dialects spoken in the Upland South to dialects spoken elsewhere.",
    optionC:
      "C. the English dialects spoken in Scotland were inuenced by dialects spoken in the Upland South.",
    optionD:
      "D. people from Scotland abandoned their emphasis on the “r” sound after relocating to the Upland South.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of English dialects spoken in Scotland and the Upland South. The text indicates that these dialects share a feature: putting emphasis on the "r" sound when it appears in certain positions in words. The text goes on to state that records indicate the Upland South was colonized largely by people of Scottish ancestry. It is reasonable to assume that the English dialects spoken by these colonizers were inuenced by the English dialects spoken by their ancestors in Scotland. It follows, then, that the emphasis on the "r" sound in the dialects in Scotland carried over into the Upland South dialects as they developed—that is, that the Upland South dialects likely acquired it from dialects spoken in Scotland. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Scottish ancestry explains the origin of the emphasis on the "r" sound in English dialects spoken in the Upland South, since that linguistic feature is also found in dialects spoken in Scotland; the text doesn’t address any other dialects or suggest that the feature will spread elsewhere. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many Upland South colonizers were the descendants of Scottish people, suggesting that the English dialects spoken by these colonizers had been inuenced by the English dialects spoken by the colonizers’ ancestors in Scotland and had acquired their emphasis on the "r" sound from those ancestors’ dialects—not the other way around. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the emphasis on the "r" sound is part of English dialects spoken in the Upland South today, which almost certainly wouldn’t be the case if people from Scotland, who were the main colonizers of the Upland South, had eliminated that linguistic feature from their dialects.',

      "D. Paris had 133 guilds and 600,000 inhabitants, or one guild for every 4,511 inhabitants.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer. The claim we’re trying to prove is that guilds were much more numerous relative to population in some cities than others. This choice describes the guilds per number of inhabitants in two cities (Rouen and Paris), showing signicant differences between guilds relative to population in these cities. Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Bordeaux had 80,000 inhabitants, according to the table, while Lyon had 143,000, so it isn’t correct to say that they had "nearly equal numbers of inhabitants." Lyon had almost twice as many inhabitants. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Although Lyon did have fewer inhabitants than Paris, it didn’t have more guilds—Paris had 133 guilds versus Lyon’s 72. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. To show that guilds were more numerous relative to population in some cities than others, we would need to compare at least two cities, and this choice only mentions one.',

They found that, although languages vary widely in the speed at which they are spoken, the amount of information languages can effectively convey tends to vary much less. Thus, they claim that two languages with very different spoken rates can nonetheless convey the same amount of information in a given amount of time. Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researchers’ claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. Among the ve languages in the table, Thai and Hungarian have the lowest rates of speech and the lowest rates of information conveye",

    optionD:
      "D. Serbian and Spanish are spoken at approximately the same rate, but Serbian conveys information faster than Spanish does.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that two languages can convey similar amounts of information even if they’re spoken at different rates. The table shows the approximate rates at which ve languages are spoken and the rates at which those ve languages convey information. Vietnamese is spoken at around 5.3 syllables per second, whereas Spanish is spoken at around 7.7 syllables per second, but the two languages convey information at very similar rates: Vietnamese at a rate of around 42.5 bits per second and Spanish at a rate of around 42.0 bits per second. Thus, the description of Vietnamese conveying information at around the same rate that Spanish does despite being spoken more slowly supports the claim in the text that languages can convey the same amount of information even if spoken at different rates. Choice A is incorrect because it isn’t true that Thai and Hungarian have the lowest rates of speech of the ve languages shown. According to the table, Hungarian is spoken at around 5.9 syllables per second, which is faster than Vietnamese (5.3 syllables per second). Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that two languages are spoken the slowest and convey information the slowest wouldn’t support the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they’re spoken at different rates. Choice C is incorrect because it isn’t true that the fastest-spoken language (Spanish, at 7.7 syllables per second) also conveys information the fastest: Spanish conveys information at 42.0 bits per second, which is slower than the 42.5 bits-per-second rate at which Vietnamese conveys information. Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that the language spoken the fastest also conveys information the fastest has no bearing on the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they’re spoken at different rates. Choice D is incorrect because it isn’t true that Serbian conveys information faster than Spanish does. According to the table, Serbian conveys information at a rate of around 39.1 bits per second, which is slower than the 42.0 bits-per-second rate at which Spanish conveys information.",

NPR began producing and distributing high-quality news and cultural programming to aliate stations across the United States in 1971. In a research paper, a student claims that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR were inspired by the British Broadcasting System (BBC), which had been established in the 1920s. Which quotation from a work by a historian would be the most effective evidence for the student to include in support of this claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. “Although the BBC had begun as a private corporation, politicians successfully argued to make it a public company because they believed a public broadcaster\ncould help build national unity in the aftermath of World War I.”",

    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because this quotation would be the most effective evidence to include in support of the claim that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR were inspired by the British Broadcasting System (BBC). The quotation states that the goal of the BBC was to support British democracy and that US legislators believed high-quality programming could accomplish the same goal for democracy in the United States. In other words, US legislators looked to the BBC as a model, taking direct inspiration from it when they created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created NPR.

      "A member of the Otomi, an Indigenous people in Central Mexico, Octavio Medellín immigrated to the United States as a child, and his sculpture bears the impress of traditions on both sides of the border: US-based modernist sculpture, Mexican modernist painting, Otomi art, and the ancient sculpture of other Mexican Indigenous peoples, including the Maya. In his 1950 masterpiece History of Mexico, Medellín fuses these inuences into a style so idiosyncratic that it resists efforts to view his work through the lens of nationality or cultural identity. Artists, he insisted, should strive for individual expression, even as they draw inspiration from their heritage and the communities where they live and work. Which quotation from an art critic most directly challenges the underlined claim in the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. “Although a number of ancient Indigenous artistic traditions pictured human forms in prole, the forms populating the surface of A History of Mexico suggest a\nspecically Maya inuence.”",

    optionD:
      "D. “While A History of Mexico features modernist motifs, it relies primarily on angular human forms in prole—a staple of Maya sculpture—and thus invites\nclassication as Indigenous art.”",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. This critic challenges the claim by arguing that A History of Mexico is not so idiosyncratic (unique) as to resist classication because its use of Maya-style human proles actually “invites classication as Indigenous art.” Therefore, according to this critic, the work can be viewed, at least partially, through a lens of national or cultural identity. Choice A is incorrect. While it describes the Maya inuence on a particular aspect of A History of Mexico, this quotation doesn’t push back on Medellín’s “idiosyncratic” (unique) style, nor does it try to categorize the entire work into a single cultural tradition. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t directly challenge the underlined claim, but rather supports it. It suggests that the work effectively blends a variety of artistic products to create a single work that can’t be dened by any one tradition. Instead, the work recalls many centuries of history and culture all at once. Choice C is incorrect. This choice supports rather than challenges the underlined claim. The quotation argues that other critics focus too much on Indigenous inuences on the artwork instead of viewing all of the inuences equally— that they should instead be viewing the work as an idiosyncratic whole instead of through one or two narrow cultural lenses.",

      "D. Articial leaves were developed to mimic the natural process of photosynthesis in plants in order to store energy for long-term commercial use.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, articial leaves are a renewable energy technology that’s in development and generating interest. The text goes on to state that articial-leaf technology "is not yet commercially viable as a large-scale energy source" and that scientists from several elds are doing additional research to rene the technology. Thus, the main idea is that continued research and development in articial-leaf technology is needed before the devices can be widely used as an energy source. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that scientists from many elds are researching articial leaves, they’re doing so to address the fact that the leaves are not yet commercially viable, rather than in response to an increase in commercial use. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does explain that articial leaves help split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen gas using catalysts, it doesn’t argue that this process is more ecient than photosynthesis. This is merely a detail of the text and not the main idea, which is about the additional research needed to improve the cost and eciency of these articial leaves. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that articial leaves mimic photosynthesis in plants, this is an incidental detail in support of the main idea that additional research is needed to make articial leaves commercially viable.',

      "Culinary anthropologist Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor may be known for her decades of work in national public television and radio, but her book Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl is likely her most inuential project. The 1970 book, whose title refers to Smart-Grosvenor’s roots in the Low Country of South Carolina, was unusual for its time. It combined memoir, recipes, travel writing, and social commentary and challenged notions about conventions of food and cooking. Long admired by many, the book and its author have shaped contemporary approaches to writing about cuisine. Which choice best describes the main idea of the text?",

      "D. Smart-Grosvenor was a talented chef whose work inspired many people to start cooking for themselves.",
    correctAnswer: 0,

The text describes the book Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl as Smart-Grosvenor’s “most inuential project” and as “unusual for its time.” The text also notes that the book and author have inuenced contemporary approaches to writing about food and cooking. Therefore, the text mainly conveys that Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl is an unconventional and important contribution to food writing. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions that Smart-Grosvenor worked in national public television and radio and was a food writer, these details aren’t the main focus. Rather than focusing on Smart-Grosvenor’s various jobs, the text focuses specically on one specic book she wrote. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl was groundbreaking, it doesn’t suggest that the book didn’t receive praise when it was published. In fact, the text states that the book is “long admired.” Choice D is incorrect because the text states that Smart-Grosvenor was a culinary anthropologist and that her book inuenced later approaches to food writing but doesn’t indicate that Smart-Grosvenor or her book inuenced people to begin cooking for themselves.",

      "Several artworks found among the ruins of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii depict a female gure shing with a cupid nearby. Some scholars have asserted that the gure is the goddess Venus, since she is known to have been linked with cupids in Roman culture, but University of Leicester archaeologist Carla Brain suggests that cupids may have also been associated with shing generally. The fact that a cupid is shown near the female gure, therefore, ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA: "A. is not conclusive evidence that the gure is Venus.",
    optionB: "B. suggests that Venus was often depicted shing.",
    optionC: "C. eliminates the possibility that the gure is Venus.",
    optionD: "D. would be dicult to account for if the gure is not Venus.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion about the signicance of the cupid found at Pompeii. The text indicates that the cupid is near a statue of a female gure who is shing, and it goes on to indicate that because Venus is associated with cupids, some scholars believe the female gure to be the goddess Venus. But the text then says that, according to archaeologist Carla Brain, cupids may have also been associated with the activity of shing, which, if true, would suggest that the mere appearance of a cupid near a female gure engaged in shing does not indicate with certainty that the gure is Venus (that is, the cupid might be associated with shing, and the gure might be anyone at all). Choice B is incorrect because the text says nothing about how often Venus was depicted shing in Roman art: it only implies that in certain instances a female gure may or may not be Venus. Choice C is incorrect because Carla Brain’s proposed explanation for the presence of the cupids makes no reference to the female gure, and so the possibility that the gure in the artworks is in fact Venus cannot be denitively eliminated. Choice D is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the only reasonable way to interpret the gure is as Venus.",

It concludes that the children in the study may have thought that a teacher who counted out loud when giving rewards cared more about fairness than a teacher who did not count out loud. Choice A is incorrect. The children in the study are described as being “four to six,” and the text doesn’t mention any differences among the different ages. Choice B is incorrect.

      "D. “She tip-toed through the hall and opened the door on the right.”",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from Happy House to illustrate the claim that the young woman is unimpressed with the house she is visiting. In the quotation, it says the young woman’s "rst feeling was of disappointment" and that "there was little claim to beauty" when referring to the house. This disappointment and the overall lack of beauty in the house suggest that the young woman isn’t impressed by the house she is visiting. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t describe what the young woman thinks about the house. Instead, it indicates that there is more light because window blinds have been opened. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation describes a door and a path outside of the house but doesn’t include anything to indicate the young woman’s feelings about the house. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation states what the young woman did in the house ("tip-toed through the hall" and "opened the door"), but it doesn’t show what she thinks about it.',

    optionD:
      "D. French people with signicant foreign investments were unlikely to have the right to vote.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. We’re told that people needed to pay “at least 300 francs in direct taxes” to be able to vote. We’re also told that, while “relatively few people paid the tax on real estate,” real estate taxes were both the main way people qualied to vote and the main source of revenue for the government. Based on this, we can infer that those who did qualify to vote likely had signicant French real estate holdings. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the voting habits of artisans and merchants nor any reduction in tax burdens on businesses, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although we know that doors and windows were taxed during the Bourbon Restoration, we don’t have enough information to infer if doors and windows increased after this time. Choice D is incorrect. Although we know that foreign investments were only minimally taxed, we don’t have enough information to determine if those with signicant foreign investments were unlikely to have voting rights. For example, it’s possible that those with signicant foreign investments were likely to also be people with signicant domestic investments which they did pay taxes on, so we don’t have the information necessary to make this inference.",

A crowd has gathered outside a room belonging to the Warden, an ocial who reports to the Lord Chancellor. One man, who was more excited than the rest, ung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as well as I could make out) “Who roar for the Sub-Warden?” Everybody roared, but whether it was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly appear: some were shouting “Bread!” and some “Taxes!”, but no one seemed to know what it was they really wanted. All this I saw from the open window of the Warden’s breakfast-saloon, looking across the shoulder of the Lord Chancellor. “What can it all mean?” he kept repeating to himself. “I never heard such shouting before—and at this time of the morning, too! And with such unanimity!” Based on the text, how does the Lord Chancellor respond to the crowd?",

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about how the Lord Chancellor responds to the crowd that is supported by the text. The text indicates that the people in the crowd are roaring and shouting “Bread!” or “Taxes!” and presents them as not knowing what they really want. The Lord Chancellor’s response is to ask what their shouting means but also to observe that they’re shouting with “unanimity,” or total agreement. Clearly, this isn’t the case, which supports the statement that the Lord Chancellor describes the crowd as being united even though it’s not. Choice A is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text. Although the text indicates that the Lord Chancellor asks about the meaning of the crowd’s shouting, it doesn’t suggest that he knows what the crowd really wants. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the Lord Chancellor wants to speak to the crowd. Furthermore, the text doesn’t indicate that the crowd wants to hear from the Sub-Warden. Although the crowd roars when asked “Who roar for the SubWarden?” it’s unclear what the roaring means. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the Lord Chancellor knows of or sympathizes with the crowd’s demands.

    question:
      "Recently, scientists looked at data collected by NASA’s InSight lander to learn more about seismic activity on Mars, known as marsquakes. The data show that the marsquakes all started from the same location on the planet. This discovery was surprising to scientists, as they expected that the marsquakes would originate from all over the planet because of the cooling of the planet’s surface. Now, scientists believe that there could be areas of active magma ows deep beneath the planet’s surface that trigger the marsquakes. According to the text, what was surprising to scientists studying the seismic activity data from NASA’s InSight lander?",
    optionA: "A. The surface temperature of Mars has been rising.",
    optionB:
      "B. There were different types of seismic waves causing marsquakes.",
    optionC:
      "C. NASA’s InSight lander collected less data than scientists had expecte",
    optionD:
      "D. All the marsquakes started from the same location on the planet.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about what surprised the scientists that is supported by the text. The text states that the marsquakes described in the data from NASA’s InSight lander originated from the same location on Mars. The text goes on to say that because they had expected the opposite (that marsquakes would originate from all over the planet) this discovery surprised the scientists. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t say that the data from NASA’s InSight lander revealed any surprising information about the planet’s surface temperature. Instead, the text mentions the cooling of Mars’s surface as a reason the scientists expected that marsquakes had multiple origins. In addition, cooling would indicate that the temperature has been falling rather than rising. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that by studying seismic activity scientists found a possible explanation for what causes marsquakes, the text doesn’t say that they discovered that marsquakes are caused by different types of seismic waves. Rather, the text states that based on the data from NASA’s InSight lander, scientists now believe that this seismic activity happens because of areas of active magma that ow below the planet’s surface. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss the amount of data NASA’s InSight lander collected or whether scientists who studied the data found the amount to be as expected. Instead, the text focuses on what the data revealed about where on Mars the marsquakes originated.",

      "Hedda Gabler is an 1890 play by Henrik Ibsen. As a woman in the Victorian era, Hedda, the play’s central character, is unable to freely determine her own future. Instead, she seeks to inuence another person’s fate, as is evident when she says to another character, ______ Which quotation from a translation of Hedda Gabler most effectively illustrates the claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. “Then what in heaven’s name would you have me do with myself?”",
    optionB:
      "B. “I want for once in my life to have power to mould a human destiny.”",
    optionC: "C. “Then I, poor creature, have no sort of power over you?”",
    optionD:
      "D. “Faithful to your principles, now and for ever! Ah, that is how a man should be!”",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim in the text that Hedda seeks to inuence another character’s fate. In the quotation, Hedda says that she wants “to have power to mould a human destiny,” or shape a person’s fate, just as the text indicates. Additionally, the phrase “for once in my life” suggests that Hedda feels that she has never been able to shape anyone’s life, including her own, supporting the text’s assertion that she “is unable to freely determine her own future.” Choice A is incorrect because this quotation shows Hedda being uncertain about what to do with her own life, not wanting to inuence another person’s fate. Choice C is incorrect because while this quotation shows Hedda’s interest in nding out whether she has any power over another character, it doesn’t clearly show that she wants to inuence that person’s fate. In this quotation, Hedda seems to have inferred or concluded (“then”) that she doesn’t have any inuence over the person to whom she’s speaking, and she’s asking that person to conrm her lack of inuence. Choice D is incorrect because this quotation expresses Hedda’s belief that a man should be true to his principles, not her desire to inuence another person’s fate.",

    optionD: "D. 0.52.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the table to complete the example of the estimated impact of invasive mongooses on threatened mammals. The table shows the values for the estimated harmful impact of three invasive predator species (mongooses, dogs, and cats) on threatened birds, mammals, and reptiles. The text states that the values are on a scale from 0.25 (less impact) to 1.00 (greater impact). The table shows that the value for the estimated impact of invasive mongooses on threatened mammals is 0.75. Choice A is incorrect because the table shows that the value for the estimated impact of mongooses on threatened mammals is 0.75, not 0.35. The value 0.35 is not assigned to any of the categories in the table. Choice B is incorrect because the table shows that 0.61 is the value for the estimated impact of cats, not mongooses, on threatened mammals.

    question:
      "In the 1970s, a roughly 60,000-year-old piece of hyena bone marked with nine notches was discovered at a site in western France once inhabited by Neanderthals. Although many believe that only modern humans developed systems for notating numbers, one archaeologist asserts that this artifact may be a sign that Neanderthals also recorded numerical information. The notches on the bone are unevenly spaced but approximately parallel, and microscopic analysis reveals that they were made with a single stone tool; according to the archaeologist, this suggests that the notches were all made at one time by one individual as a means of counting something. Which nding, if true, would most directly weaken the underlined claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. Parallel lines are a common feature in modern humans’ early systems for recording numerical information.",
    optionB:
      "B. More than nine approximately parallel notches made with a different stone tool are present on another artifact found at a site in western France.",
    optionC:
      "C. It would have taken careful effort to make evenly spaced lines on bone with the stone tools typically used by Neanderthals.",
    optionD:
      "D. Decorative art discovered at another Neanderthal site in western France primarily features patterns of unevenly spaced parallel lines.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. The archeologist bases their claim on the fact that the hyena bone features unevenly spaced parallel notches. But if unevenly spaced parallel lines were found on "decorative art" at another Neanderthal site, it would suggest that the hyena bone is probably decorative art as well—not a counting tool. Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. If anything, it might actually strengthen the claim: assuming we can make an inference about Neanderthals using a fact about early humans, it provides more support for the idea that the person who made the notches was counting something. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. The fact that another artifact had parallel notches made with a different stone tool doesn’t tell us anything about the use of either artifact. For all we know, they could both have been used for counting. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. The fact that it took effort to make the lines doesn’t tell us anything about what the lines were for.',

He did not put down his book when the postman brought him a letter. He just glanced indifferently at the letter, and impatiently at the postman. Zerviah Holme did not like to be interrupted when he was reading Gibbon; and as he was always reading Gibbon, an interruption was always regarded by him as an insult. Based on the text, how did Zerviah Holme most likely feel when the letter was delivered?",
    optionA:

    optionD:
      "D. He felt annoyed because he was interrupted while reading his favorite author.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it presents a description of how Zerviah Holme felt that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Holme "did not like to be interrupted" while reading Gibbon and that he considered interruptions to be "an insult." Furthermore, the text suggests that Gibbon is Holme’s favorite author because, as the text states, "he was always reading Gibbon." Thus, Holme would have felt annoyed at having been interrupted when the letter was delivered. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Holme is relieved to receive the letter. Instead, the text states that Holme "just glanced indifferently at the letter," suggesting that the letter wasn’t important to him. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Holme is excited to receive the letter. Instead, the text states that Holme didn’t put down his book to receive the letter and that he looked at the letter "indifferently" and at the postman "impatiently." This suggests that Holme isn’t excited. Also, there is no mention that Holme knows who sent the letter. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Holme is sad or that he wants to speak with the postman.

      "The novelist Toni Morrison was the rst Black woman to work as an editor at the publishing company Random House, from 1967 to 1983. A scholar asserts that one of Morrison’s likely aims during her time as an editor was to strengthen the presence of Black writers on the list of Random House’s published authors. Which nding, if true, would most strongly support the scholar’s claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. The percentage of authors published by Random House who were Black rose in the early 1970s and stabilized throughout the decade.",
    optionB:
      "B. Black authors who were interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s were highly likely to cite Toni Morrison’s novels as a principal inuence on their work.",
    optionC:

    optionD:
      "D. Works that were edited by Toni Morrison during her time at Random House displayed stylistic characteristics that distinguished them from works that were not\nedited by Morrison.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support the scholar’s claim about Toni Morrison’s likely goal of strengthening the presence of Black writers on Random House’s list of published authors. The text explains that Morrison was the rst Black woman to be an editor for Random House and that she was an editor there from 1967 to 1983. If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s—during most of Morrison’s time working there—than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House’s published authors, thus supporting the scholar’s claim. Choice B is incorrect because the scholar’s claim is about Morrison’s work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company’s list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison’s novels as an inuence on their work, but that nding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn’t show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar’s claim is about Morrison’s work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist. Therefore, a nding that Morrison’s novels published after 1983 sold more copies and were more widely acclaimed than her earlier novels would have no bearing on the claim that as an editor Morrison made an effort to ensure that more Black writers were present on Random House’s list of published authors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses Morrison’s work as an editor at Random House, the scholar’s claim focuses on Morrison’s likely effort in that role to increase the number of Black writers present on Random House’s list of published authors, not on the inuence she may have had on the content of the works she edited. Without knowing whether Morrison’s stylistic inuence led to more publications or if Morrison applied her inuence specically to works by Black writers, the nding that works edited by Morrison could be identied by stylistic characteristics would have no bearing on the claim that Morrison intended to strengthen the presence of Black writers among the published authors at Random House.",

    optionA:
      "A. “What does this brazen tongue declare, / That falling on the midnight air / Brings to my heart a sense of care / Akin to fright?”",
    optionB:
      "B. “The snow has ceased its uttering ight, / The wind sunk to a whisper light, / An ominous stillness lls the night, / A pause—a hush.”",
    optionC:

    optionD:
      "D. “And so the years go swiftly by, / Each, coming, brings ambitions high, / And each, departing, leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.”",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the quotation that most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker of the poem describes experiencing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reection. In this quotation, the speaker notes that as years go by, “Each, coming”—that is, each new year as it comes—“brings ambitions high.” In other words, the speaker begins each new year with large goals. But the speaker goes on to say that as each year ends (“each, departing”), it “leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.” A sigh is an expression of longing or regret, so in the context of the whole quotation, this portion suggests that at the end of each year, the speaker regretfully reects on not having achieved the ambitions formed at the beginning of the year. The phrases “the years go swiftly by,” “Each, coming,” and “each, departing” indicate that this experience happens over and over again: the speaker experiences a cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reection. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation does not describe an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reection. Instead, the speaker describes experiencing a sensation similar to fright as a result of something that has occurred at midnight. Specically, the speaker has heard a “brazen tongue,” a gurative way of saying that the speaker has heard the clang of a bronze bell being rung. Choice B is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of anticipation through its reference to “ominous stillness,” there is no suggestion of regretful reection or any indication that the speaker is describing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by such reection. Instead, the speaker is describing a particular moment when a winter storm appears to have momentarily calmed. Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of regret (“many a squandered day”), nothing in the quotation suggests an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regret. Instead, the speaker is simply lamenting wasted time and opportunities.",

    optionD:
      "D. “When [the banker] got home he lay on his bed, but his tears and emotion kept him for hours from sleeping.”",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from "The Bet" to illustrate the claim that the banker was very upset about something. The quotation indicates that the banker shed tears, which suggests that he was likely unhappy about something, and that his emotions were so strong that they kept him from sleeping for hours. These details suggest that the banker was very upset. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation mainly describes the banker cautiously unlocking a door; it doesn’t suggest that he was particularly upset about anything. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t mention whether the banker was experiencing any particularly strong negative feelings; instead, the quotation focuses on the quietness of the setting. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation states that the banker was feeling "delighted," not that he was upset.',

    question:
      "Some animal-behavior studies involve observing wild animals in their natural habitat, and some involve capturing wild animals and observing them in a laboratory. Each approach has advantages over the other. In wild studies, researchers can more easily presume that the animals are behaving normally, and in lab studies, researchers can more easily control factors that might affect the results. But if, for example, the results from a wild study and a lab study of Western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) contradict each other, one or both of the studies must have failed to account for some factor that was relevant to the birds’ behavior. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",

    optionD:
      "D. Differing results between natural-habitat and lab studies of wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay are a strong indication that both of the studies had\ndesign aws that affected the accuracy of their results.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by explaining that wild animals can be studied in their natural habitat or in a laboratory setting, with each setting offering unique advantages to researchers. The text then highlights an instance in which Western scrubjays were studied in both settings but with conicting results, indicating that one or both studies may have failed to account for the disadvantages of its research setting. Thus, the main idea of the text is that while wild animals can be effectively studied in natural or lab settings, there are drawbacks to each that need to be considered to ensure accurate results. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not position one study setting (natural or lab) as superior to the other; rather, the text states that each one has advantages over the other. Choice B is incorrect. The text provides a hypothetical example of two studies in different environments with conicting results, but this single example cannot be extrapolated to a general claim about the likelihood that results of studies in different environments will conict. Additionally, the text does not assert anything about how researchers can or cannot resolve conicting study results. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not state that discrepancies between natural-habitat and lab-based animal behavior studies are due to both of the designs being awed. Rather, the text states that the conict in results can be the consequence of one or both of the studies having failed to account for some factor.",

Davis focuses on how Rainey and Smith improvised the lyrics—replacing the original lines with mischievous jokes and wordplay. Davis’s work was particularly labor intensive because in order to transcribe, or write down, the lyrics as Rainey and Smith sang them, Davis had to listen repeatedly to the vinyl recordings, which weren’t very clear.

    optionD:
      "D. According to Davis, the songs sung by Rainey were more musically innovative than those sung by Smith typically were.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it describes the songs sung by Gertrude "Ma" Rainey and Bessie Smith in a way the text implies is accurate. The text describes Angela Y. Davis’s research on Rainey and Smith for her book Blues Legacies and Black Feminism, focusing on her efforts to transcribe the improvised lyrics in Rainey’s and Smith’s songs. The text calls Davis’s transcription process "labor intensive" since the lack of clarity in the recordings required her to listen to each repeatedly to verify the accuracy of her transcripts. The fact that Davis undertook a painstaking transcription process using only fairly low-delity recordings suggests that reliable transcriptions were otherwise unavailable to her. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss the popularity of Rainey’s and Smith’s songs either in the 1920s or after. Although it is plausible that the music of Rainey and Smith is more widely enjoyed than it was in the 1920s, this isn’t supported by the text. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss which of Rainey and Smith was the more prolic recording artist and so provides no support for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect.

    optionD:
      "D. The method for determining the composition of rocky planets is discovered to be less effective when used to analyze other kinds of planets.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would weaken the astronomers’ claim about the makeup of host stars and their planets. The text explains that because stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust, astronomers believe planets should be composed of the same materials as their host stars, but in equal or smaller quantities. The nding that the amount of iron in some rocky planets is much higher than the amount in their host star would weaken the astronomers’ claim because it would show that some planets contain the same material as their host star, but in higher quantities. Choice A is incorrect because a nding only about the makeup of stars, whether they’ve cooled or not, would provide no information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn’t have any bearing on the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice B is incorrect because a nding about two host stars having similar proportions of certain materials wouldn’t provide any information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn’t be relevant to the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the astronomers’ claim is based on a fact—that stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust in space—which would remain true regardless of the effectiveness of a method for analysis of compositions. The text does cite analysis of rocky planets in our solar system and the Sun, but only as a single piece of evidence that is consistent with the claim and not as the source of the claim; the nding that the method used for that analysis is less effective in other scenarios wouldn’t weaken a claim that’s based on knowledge of how stars and planets initially form.",

    question:
      "The Souls of Black Folk is a 1903 book by W.E.B. Du Bois. In the book, Du Bois suggests that upon hearing Black folk songs, he felt an intuitive and sometimes unexpected sense of cultural recognition: ______ Which quotation from The Souls of Black Folk most effectively illustrates the claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. “[Black folk music] still remains as the singular spiritual heritage of the nation and the greatest gift of the Negro people.”",
    optionB:
      "B. “Ever since I was a child these songs have stirred me strangely. They came out of the South unknown to me, one by one, and yet at once I knew them as of me\nand of mine.”",
    optionC:
      "C. “Caricature has sought again to spoil the quaint beauty of the music, and has lled the air with many debased melodies which vulgar ears scarce know from the\nreal. But the true Negro folk-song still lives in the hearts of those who have heard them truly sung and in the hearts of the Negro people.”",
    optionD:
      "D. “The songs are indeed the siftings of centuries; the music is far more ancient than the words, and in it we can trace here and there signs of development.”",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because the quotation from The Souls of Black Folk illustrates the claim that Du Bois felt a sense of cultural recognition when he heard Black folk songs. In the quotation, Du Bois explains that for his entire life, Black folk songs “stirred [him] strangely.” Even though they originated in the South, a region he wasn’t familiar with, he knew the songs “as of me and of mine.” That is, he identied strongly with them and associated them with his community. Therefore, Du Bois felt an intuitive sense of cultural recognition when he heard Black folk songs. Choice A is incorrect. Although the quotation considers the cultural and spiritual value of Black folk music, it doesn’t establish that this music inspired in Du Bois a sense of cultural recognition. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation addresses the cultural survival of Black folk songs despite attempts to caricature, or parody, them, not Du Bois’s sense of cultural connection to them. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation indicates that the Black folk songs and music are old, “the siftings of centuries,” instead of addressing how Du Bois felt when he heard the songs.",

      "Many archaeologists will tell you that categorizing excavated fragments of pottery by style, period, and what objects they belong to relies not only on standard criteria, but also on instinct developed over years of practice. In a recent study, however, researchers trained a deep-learning computer model on thousands of images of pottery fragments and found that it could categorize them as accurately as a team of expert archaeologists. Some archaeologists have expressed concern that they might be replaced by such computer models, but the researchers claim that outcome is highly unlikely. Which nding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ claim?",
    optionA:
      "A. In the researchers’ study, the model was able to categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the archaeologists coul",

    optionD:
      "D. A survey of archaeologists showed that few of them received dedicated training in how to properly categorize pottery fragments.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text explains that although archaeologists hold that categorizing pottery fragments relies on both objective criteria and instinct developed through direct experience, researchers have found that a computer model can categorize the fragments with the same degree of accuracy as the humans can—a nding that has caused some archaeologists to worry that their own work won’t be needed any longer. If survey results indicate that categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount of time archaeologists can dedicate to other important tasks that only human experts can do, that would mean that computer models aren’t able to do all of the important things archaeologists do, thus supporting the researchers’ claim that computer models are unlikely to replace human archaeologists. Choice A is incorrect because if it were true that the computer model could categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the archaeologists could, that would weaken the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models, since it would demonstrate that the models could conduct the archaeologists’ work not only with equal accuracy but also at a faster pace. Choice B is incorrect because the inability of both the computer model and the archaeologists to accurately categorize all of the pottery fragments presented wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text indicates that some archaeologists are worried because the computer model’s accuracy is equal to their own, and that could be the case whether both were perfectly accurate or were unable to achieve complete accuracy. Choice D is incorrect because survey results showing that few archaeologists received special training in properly categorizing pottery fragments wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The amount of special training in categorizing pottery fragments that archaeologists have received has no direct bearing on whether computer models’ success at categorizing fragments will lead to the models replacing the archaeologists.",

      "The following text is from Edith Nesbit’s 1902 novel Five Children and It. Five young siblings have just moved with their parents from London to a house in the countryside that they call the White House. It was not really a pretty house at all; it was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient, and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the ironwork on the roof and coping was like an architect’s nightmare. But the house was deep in the country, with no other house in sight, and the children had been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise.

But biologist Angela Stöger and her team analyzed hundreds of hours of recordings of giraffes in three European zoos and found that giraffes make a very low-pitched humming sound. The researchers claim that the giraffes use these sounds to communicate when it’s not possible for them to signal one another visually.

    optionC: "C. Wild giraffes have never been recorded making humming sounds.",
    optionD: "D. Researchers observed other animals in European zoos humming.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a nding that, if true, would support Stöger and her team’s claim that giraffes use humming to communicate when they cannot signal to one another visually. The text indicates that scientists have long thought that giraffes produce little sound and exclusively rely on visual signals to communicate with one another. The text goes on to say, however, that Stöger and her team have recorded giraffes in three European zoos making a lowpitched humming sound, which the team claims the giraffes use to communicate when they cannot see each other. If the giraffes produced these sounds when visual communication was impossible and never produced them otherwise, that would support Stöger and her team’s claim about the circumstance in which giraffes make the sound. Choice A is incorrect because nding that giraffes have excellent vision and can see in color would have no bearing on Stöger and her team’s claim that giraffes produce a low-pitched humming noise to communicate when they cannot communicate visually. As presented in the text, Stöger and her team’s claim is restricted to circumstances in which giraffes cannot signal one another visually; if the giraffes are unable to signal visually, their sense of vision is irrelevant to their communication. Choice C is incorrect because nding that wild giraffes have never been recorded making humming noises would not support Stöger and her team’s claim about the function of the humming noise that the researchers recorded from the giraffes in European zoos. The text provides no information about whether researchers have even attempted to record low-pitched humming in wild giraffes, so nothing can be concluded about the implications of the lack of such recordings. Choice D is incorrect because nding that other animals in European zoos had been observed humming would not support Stöger and her team’s claim, since it would not indicate anything about why giraffes produce humming sounds. Different species could produce similar sounds for different purposes, so scientists could not conclude anything about the function of giraffe humming from a nding that some other animals in zoos also hum.",

In a research article, Marisela Granito and Glenda Álvarez from Simón Bolívar University in Venezuela claim that inducing fermentation of black beans using lactic acid bacteria improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious. Which nding from Granito and Álvarez’s research, if true, would most directly support their claim?",

    optionD:
      "D. Both fermented and nonfermented black beans contained signicantly fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins after being cooked at high pressure.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a nding that would best support Granito and Álvarez’s claim that fermenting black beans makes them easier to digest and more nutritious. The text indicates that high levels of soluble ber and ranose in black beans make the beans hard to digest and that tannins and trypsin inhibitors make it harder for the body to extract nutrients from the beans. If it were found that fermenting the beans signicantly reduces their levels of soluble ber, ranose, trypsin inhibitors, and tannins when cooked, this would directly support the claim that fermentation improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that trypsin inhibitors and tannins interfere with the body’s ability to extract nutrients from black beans; if fermentation and cooking were found to increase these antinutrients, fermented beans would likely be less nutritious than unfermented ones, not more nutritious (as Granito and Álvarez claim). Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the idea that greater nitrogen absorption in the gut has an effect on a food’s digestibility or level of nutrition, so the discovery of the presence of microorganisms that may increase nitrogen absorption wouldn’t provide relevant support for the claim that fermentation makes black beans easier to digest and more nutritious. Choice D is incorrect because Granito and Álvarez’s claim focuses on the effect of fermenting black beans, but the nding that nonfermented black beans also have fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins when cooked at high pressure would suggest that the role of the cooking method could be signicant when it comes to nutrition; further, the nding wouldn’t address the beans’ digestibility.",

Researchers Jenna Ekwealor and Kirsten M. Fisher found several species of Syntrichia caninervis, a type of desert moss, growing under quartz crystals in California’s Mojave Desert. To evaluate whether these semitransparent rocks beneted the moss, the researchers compared the shoot tissue, a measure of plant growth, of S. caninervis when growing on the soil surface versus when the moss was growing under the quartz rocks. They found that the shoot tissue was 62% longer for moss growing under the quartz as compared to moss on the soil surface, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. S. caninervis is one of the few types of moss that can survive under semitransparent rocks.",
    optionB:
      "B. quartz crystals do not transmit the necessary sunlight for photosynthesis in S. caninervis.",
    optionC:
      "C. S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture.",
    optionD:
      "D. quartz crystals are capable of supporting S. caninervis growth if the crystals are not too thin.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text. The text explains that while desert moss species need sucient sunlight for photosynthesis, exposure to sunlight can also affect the plants negatively by drying them out. Ekwealor and Fisher’s team found specimens of S. caninervis moss growing under quartz crystals that were semitransparent, allowing some but not all sunlight to pass through them, and the shoot tissue of these specimens was longer than that of S. caninervis specimens found growing on the surface that were unprotected by such crystals. Since, as the text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an indicator of plant growth, and since greater exposure to sunlight results in greater loss of moisture, it can be inferred that S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention another moss species besides S. caninervis or discuss whether other such species are able to grow under transparent crystals, as S. caninervis is. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text explains, specimens of S. caninervis were found growing under quartz crystals and exhibited more plant growth than specimens growing on the soil surface. This wouldn’t have been the case if the crystals transmitted insucient light for the moss’s photosynthesis. Choice D is incorrect. The text contrasts the growth of S. caninervis specimens found beneath semitransparent quartz crystals with that of specimens found on the soil surface absent such crystals, but it doesn’t make a comparison among specimens growing beneath crystals of different degrees of thickness or consider how the relative thickness of the crystals affects the growth of the moss.",

      "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of how participants considered messages from former trial volunteers and doctors. The text rst establishes that information coming from credentialed experts typically increases the credibility of that information. However, the text goes on to describe a situation that goes against this expectation: the messages from previous trial volunteers were judged as more credible than the messages from licensed doctors when recruiting clinic trial participants. The text then goes on to speculate as to why this may have been the case, stating that participants likely considered the messages from the former trial volunteers to be more convincing than the messages from the doctors because the former trial volunteers were perceived as having undergone the same experience that the participants were considering. It is reasonable to infer, then, that participants regarded the former trial volunteers’ direct experience as more important to their decision-making than the doctors’ status as credentialed experts. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not provide any indication as to the content or the tone of the messages provided by either the doctors or the former trial volunteers regarding the clinical trials. Choice B is incorrect. Since the study participants had not themselves participated in the clinical trial, they could not rely on their experience to evaluate the credibility of either the former trial volunteers or the doctors. Choice D is incorrect. While the text does establish that the participants likely considered the messages from both the doctors and the former trial volunteers, it does not suggest that the participants doubted the doctors’ credentials. Rather, the text speculates that participants may have given the experiences of the former trial volunteers more importance than the doctors’ credentials when considering the recruitment messages.",

    question:
      "To better understand the burrowing habits of Alpheus bellulus (the tiger pistol shrimp), some studies have used resin casting to obtain precise measurements of the shrimps’ burrows. Resin casting involves completely lling an empty burrow with a liquid plastic that hardens to create a three-dimensional model; however, recovering the model inevitably requires destroying the burrow. In their 2022 study, Miyu Umehara and colleagues discovered that an x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner can accurately record a burrow’s measurements both at a moment in time and throughout the entire burrow-building process, something that’s impossible with resin casting because ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA: "A. bellulus takes to construct a burrow.",

      "B. it does not allow for multiple castings of the same burrow over time.",
    optionC: "C. the casting process takes more time than",
    optionD:
      "D. the process of recovering the model distorts the resin’s shape.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. Since resin casting “inevitably requires destroying the burrow,” it would be impossible to make multiple castings of the same burrow over time. Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t discuss size requirements for completing resin casting, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage never mentions how long the casting process takes nor how long A. bellulus takes to construct a borrow, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage never states that recovering the model distorts the resin’s shape, only that it destroys the burrow. Therefore, there’s no basis for this inference.",

    question:
      "Violins made by Antonio Stradivari and other craftspeople in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries in Cremona, Italy, produce a sound that is considered superior to that of modern stringed instruments. Some experts have claimed that the type of wood used to create Cremonese violins is responsible for their prized sound, but modern and Cremonese violins are made of the same kinds of wood: maple and spruce. New analysis, however, has revealed unique indications that the wood in the older violins was chemically treated by the makers, leading researchers to suggest that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. Cremonese violins probably were not considered superior to other instruments at the time they were made.",
    optionB:
      "B. the sound quality of Cremonese violins results in part from a method the craftspeople used to alter the woo",
    optionC:
      "C. if modern violins were made of a wood other than maple or spruce, they likely would sound as good as Cremonese violins.",
    optionD:
      "D. the current process of making violins is the same process that was used centuries ago by Cremonese craftspeople.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the sound quality of Cremonese and modern violins. The text states that violins made in Cremona in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries sound superior to modern violins. It then indicates that some experts attribute the difference to different woods being used to make these violins, but both Cremonese and modern violins are made of the same woods (maple and spruce); thus this cannot account for the difference. The text then says that recent analysis suggests the wood in Cremonese violins was chemically treated by the craftspeople who made them, thereby providing an alternate explanation for the sound differences: the chemical alteration that is present in the Cremonese violins but absent from the modern ones. Choice A is incorrect because the text does not discuss how the sound quality of Cremonese violins compares with the sound quality of other instruments made during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Instead it focuses on how the sound of the Cremonese violins compares with that of modern violins. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that there are differences in sound quality between the Cremonese and modern violins, and that both types of violin are made with maple or spruce. Thus the type of wood alone does not determine a violin’s sound quality. Furthermore, even if the type of wood alone could account for differences in sound quality, the text makes no mention of other woods, so there is no basis to judge how modern violins would sound if they were made using woods besides maple and spruce. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that there is evidence that Cremonese craftspeople chemically treated the wood used in Cremonese violins. This evidence is attributed to “new analysis,” which strongly suggests that this process was unknown to modern violin makers before that analysis. If the chemical treatment was unknown until recently, the manufacturing process for modern violins must differ with respect to the previously unknown practice of chemically treating the wood.",

    optionD:
      "D. nding a mentor is more important for musicians than it is for painters, writers, and other types of artists.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the relationship between the AACM’s use of mentors to support young Black musicians and similar support that other organizations offer their young artists. According to the text, in service of AACM’s goal to support new works by Black musicians, AACM mentors provide benecial training and guidance to young artists. The text goes on to say that many other art organizations support new artists in similar ways, suggesting that these organizations recognize the importance of providing opportunities for young artists to learn from mentors who are established in their eld. Choice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that technical training is more benecial than creative guidance. The text states that AACM mentors offer both technical training and creative guidance to young artists and that other arts organizations offer similar kinds of support; however, nothing in the text suggests that young artists, or artists of any age, benet more from technical training. Choice C is incorrect because the text is mainly concerned with the fact that established artists are mentoring young artists through AACM and other arts organizations. The text states that young musicians benet from AACM mentors but does not address what mentors gain from the relationship, so there is no reason to conclude that most established artists could improve as artists by serving as mentors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that mentors are benecial to young musicians and that young people pursuing other kinds of art (including painting and writing) can also nd mentors through arts organizations, the text gives no indication that mentors are more important for musicians than for other types of artists.",

A team led by Shai Meiri of Tel Aviv University investigated which factors inuence lizard clutch size. Meiri’s team obtained clutch-size and habitat data for over 3,900 lizard species and analyzed the data with statistical models. Larger clutch size was associated with environments in higher latitudes that have more seasonal change.

      "Choice B is the best answer. “Ultimately” means “in the long run” or “at the highest level.” Although Bolívar wrote to a local merchant, his ultimate goal was to send a message to political leaders in Europe. Therefore, “ultimately” ts perfectly in this context. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea.

      "For years, biologists have experimented with using grime-eating bacteria rather than harsh chemicals to clean artworks, and results have been impressive overall. ______ these bacterial strains—which can metabolize centuries’ worth of oil, glue, dirt, and other surface impurities without creating harmful byproducts—have proven more effective than traditional chemical cleaning methods. Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?",
    optionA: "A. However,",
    optionB: "B. In many cases,",
    optionC: "C. As a result,",
    optionD: "D. Additionally,",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. The rst sentence makes the claim that using grime-eating bacteria has led to “impressive results.” This sentence supports that claim by describing the specic ndings of the biologists’ experimentation. The transition “in many cases” ts the context perfectly. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both claim that grime-eating bacteria are better at cleaning artworks than chemicals. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense in context. The fact that the results of the experimentation have been impressive overall doesn’t cause the bacteria to have proven more effective. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new idea. But this sentence doesn’t introduce a new idea. Instead, it elaborates on the same idea laid out in the previous sentence by describing the “impressive results” in more detail.",

The sentence contrasts rst-class levers and second-class levers, explaining that the fulcrum in a rst-class lever is between the effort and the load, whereas in a second-class lever the load is between the effort and the fulcrum. Choice A is incorrect. The sentence denes two terms associated with levers; it doesn’t contrast rst-class levers and second-class levers. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence seems to acknowledge a general difference in fulcrum and load locations between rst-class and second-class levers, it does not specify what this difference is. Moreover, the sentence could be read as emphasizing a similarity—that in both types of levers, the fulcrum and load are in different locations.

    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. This sentence compares a chiral molecule to an achiral one. It discusses how when a chiral molecule is ipped, it results in something very different than when an achiral molecule is ipped. So the transition "by contrast" ts the context perfectly. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in different words. But this sentence doesn’t restate the same idea as the previous sentence. Instead, it makes a new point about a different type of molecule (chiral instead of achiral). Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example, which doesn’t make sense here. The second sentence isn’t an example of the rst sentence’s claim about achiral molecules: it actually introduces an entirely different idea that focuses on chiral molecules. Choice D is incorrect.

    optionD: "D. For instance,",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. "As a result" logically signals that the information in the sentence—that, in the US House of Representatives, the entire state of Alaska has just one district—is the result or consequence of Alaska having only about 730,000 people. This is slightly below the average for House districts, which are designed to have roughly equal populations. Choice B is incorrect because "instead" illogically signals that Alaska having just one state district is an alternative to the information about the state’s population in the previous sentence. Rather, the fact that Alaska has just one district is a result or consequence of the entire state having slightly fewer people than an averagesized district. Choice C is incorrect because "nally" illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Alaska having just one district indicates a last step in a process or a concluding summary. Instead, the fact that Alaska has just one district is a result or consequence of the entire state having slightly fewer people than an average-sized district. Choice D is incorrect because "for instance" illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Alaska having just one district exemplies the information about the state’s population in the previous sentence.

    question:
      "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: The magnicent frigatebird (fregata magnicens) is a species of seabird that feeds mainly on sh, tuna, squid, and other small sea animals. It is unusual among seabirds in that it doesn’t dive into the water for prey. One way it acquires food is by using its hook-tipped bill to snatch prey from the surface of the water. Another way it acquires food is by taking it from weaker birds by force. This behavior is known as kleptoparasitism. The student wants to emphasize a similarity between the two ways a magnicent frigatebird acquires food. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",
    optionA:
      "A. A magnicent frigatebird never dives into the water, instead using its hook-tipped bill to snatch prey from the surface.",
    optionB:
      "B. Neither of a magnicent frigatebird’s two ways of acquiring food requires the bird to dive into the water.",
    optionC:
      "C. Of the magnicent frigatebird’s two ways of acquiring food, only one is known as kleptoparasitism.",
    optionD:
      "D. In addition to snatching prey from the water with its hook-tipped bill, a magnicent frigatebird takes food from other birds by force.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a similarity between the two ways a magnicent frigatebird acquires food, noting that neither way requires the seabird to dive into the water. Choice A is incorrect. The sentence describes how a magnicent frigatebird captures prey without diving into water; it doesn’t emphasize a similarity between the two ways the seabird acquires food. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence notes the term used to describe one of the two ways that magnicent frigatebirds acquire food; it doesn’t emphasize a similarity between the two ways. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence describes the two ways that a magnicent frigatebird acquires food; it doesn’t emphasize a similarity between the two ways.",

    optionD: "D. For instance,",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. "For instance" logically signals that the concise, witty exchange between Philip II and the Spartans is an example supporting the previous claim—that the Spartans employed wit even in the face of peril. Choice A is incorrect because "rather" illogically signals that the exchange between Philip II and the Spartans contrasts with the previous claim about the Spartans’ wit. Instead, the exchange is an example of their wit. Choice B is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the exchange between Philip II and the Spartans is a restatement of the previous claim about the Spartans’ wit. Instead, the exchange is an example of their wit. Choice C is incorrect because "that said" illogically signals that the exchange between Philip II and the Spartans is an exception to the previous claim about the Spartans’ wit.

      "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: Archaeologist Jon Erlandson and colleagues argue that humans rst arrived in the Americas by sea. They propose that humans traveled between Pacic Ocean islands and coastlines from northeast Asia to the Americas. Many of these islands and coastal zones were later submerged as glaciers melted and sea levels rose. The researchers think that “a coastal route, including kelp forests and estuaries, would have provided a rich mix of marine, estuarine, riverine, and terrestrial resources” such as seaweeds, sh, and birds. This proposed scenario is known as the kelp highway hypothesis. The student wants to summarize the kelp highway hypothesis.

      "In the search for extraterrestrial life, astrobiologists Stuart Bartlett and Michael L. Wong propose that scientists avoid using the term “life.” ______ researchers should use another word: “lyfe.” This new term, they argue, could be used to draw distinctions between the known characteristics of life on Earth and the potentially differing characteristics of lyfe on other planets. Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?",
    optionA: "A. Previously,",
    optionB: "B. Regardless,",
    optionC: "C. There,",
    optionD: "D. Instead,",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. "Instead" logically signals that the idea in this sentence—that researchers should use the word "lyfe"—is an alternative to the idea mentioned in the previous sentence (scientists’ use of the word "life"). Choice A is incorrect because "previously" illogically signals that the idea in this sentence occurs before the action in the rst sentence. Instead, the use of "lyfe" is an alternative to the previously mentioned use of "life." Choice B is incorrect because "regardless" illogically signals that the idea in this sentence is true despite the information in the rst sentence. Instead, the use of "lyfe" is an alternative to the previously mentioned use of "life." Choice C is incorrect because "there" illogically signals that the idea in this sentence occurs in a place mentioned in the previous sentence.

However, recent research has demonstrated that the episode was neither as frenzied nor as disastrous as has been thought. The popular myth surrounding it, ______ should be regarded with some skepticism. Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?",
    optionA: "A. for example,",
    optionB: "B. by contrast,",
    optionC: "C. nevertheless,",
    optionD: "D. therefore,",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. This sentence is arguing that new evidence contradicting popular beliefs about “tulip mania” should cast doubt on those beliefs. “Therefore” is a cause-and-effect transition, which ts perfectly in this context. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplication transition, which doesn’t make sense here. Skepticism about the popular beliefs is not an example of recent evidence contradicting those beliefs—rather, skepticism is an effect of that recent evidence. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous sentence. Instead, it connects a cause from the previous sentence (new evidence that tulip mania was not as disastrous as thought) to an effect (that we should look with skepticism upon the myth about its disastrousness).

      "With its clichéd imagery of suburban lawns and power lines, John Ashbery’s 2004 poem “Ignorance of the Law Is No Excuse” may seem barren terrain for critical analysis. ______ cultural critic Lauren Berlant nds fertile ground in just its rst two stanzas, devoting most of a book chapter to deciphering the “weight of the default space” Ashbery creates in this poem. Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?",
    optionA: "A. Likewise,",
    optionB: "B. Nonetheless,",
    optionC: "C. In turn,",
    optionD: "D. That is,",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. “Nonetheless” is a transition that indicates disagreement. The rst sentence describes the unlikelihood of nding much for critical analysis in Ashbery’s poem (“barren terrain”), while the second sentence describes how Berlant did in fact nd much to analyze in Ashbery’s poem (“fertile ground”), so the transition “nonetheless” ts perfectly. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new but similar idea, which doesn’t make sense here. The idea in this sentence directly contradicts the idea in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense in this context—a poem seemingly having little opportunity for critical analysis would not cause someone to write an extensive critical analysis (in fact, we might expect the opposite). Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in other words. But the text isn’t restating the rst idea here.

"With this in mind" logically signals that the activity described in this sentence—Dominguez’s use of techniques like decalcomania to produce unpredictable abstract patterns—is a result of his desire to include random elements in his art. Choice B is incorrect. "On the contrary" illogically signals that the activity in this sentence opposes or is contrary to Dominguez’s desire to use random elements in his art. Instead, his use of decalcomania is a result of that desire. Choice C is incorrect.

    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. Scientists believe in fusion’s potential as an energy source, but have struggled to actually make it work—in other words, there is a contradiction between scientists’ beliefs and their reality. “That said” is a disagreement transition that works perfectly in this context. Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. Scientists not being able to generate extra energy from lab fusion reactions isn’t an effect of them believing in fusion’s potential. Choice B is incorrect. This transition indicates the addition of another supporting point. But this sentence is not adding a supporting point to the previous sentence—scientists not being able to successfully generate energy from fusion isn’t another point in favor of fusion meeting humanity’s clean energy needs. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces or elaborates on a particular example. But this sentence doesn’t give an example of scientists’ belief in fusion’s potential to meet humanity’s clean energy needs—in fact, it contrasts that optimistic belief with the reality of past failures to successfully employ fusion for energy production.",

    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Marilyn Dingle’s baskets. In this context, to say that Dingle’s baskets are “handmade from” particular plants means that Dingle creates baskets herself using those plants but without using machines. The text says that Dingle “skillfully winds” parts of palmetto palm plants around sweetgrass plants to make baskets with an appearance that “no factory can reproduce.” This context suggests that Dingle’s baskets are handmade from sweetgrass and palmetto palm.

    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the invention of the integrated circuit. As used in this context, "transformed" means substantially changed in some way. The text states that the invention radically altered the semiconductor industry, with some historians claiming that it had a fundamental effect on the industry by allowing for mass production for the rst time. This context conveys that the invention of the integrated circuit transformed the semiconductor industry. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the invention of the integrated circuit signicantly affected ("radically altered") the semiconductor industry, it doesn’t indicate that the invention "overwhelmed" the industry, which in this context would mean that it overcame the industry such that the industry struggled or was defeated. Instead, the text conveys that the invention’s effect was positive, since it allowed the semiconductor industry to begin making use of mass production methods. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that the invention of the integrated circuit "bypassed" the semiconductor industry, which would mean it intentionally avoided the industry. The text indicates that the invention directly affected the semiconductor industry, since it made it possible for the industry to begin engaging in mass production methods.

      "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “singular” most nearly means extraordinary.

After prolonged contact with the liquid, the rose begins to absorb it, undergoing an exceptional transformation: its color deepens, its previously “crushed and dried” petals shift, and the entire ower revives “from a deathlike slumber.” In other words, an extraordinary change is visible in the ower. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts “singular” can mean of or relating to an individual or to a single instance of something, this usage doesn’t imply loneliness or an otherwise unsatisfactory condition of isolation. Moreover, the text doesn’t attribute such a condition to the rose. Choice B is incorrect. Although “singular” has several related meanings, none of them relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant.

    optionC: "C. ambiguous",
    optionD: "D. unpretentious",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. A person who is "dogmatic" believes strongly that their principles and opinions are true. Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one "unied vision" of Black American identity that they prioritize over the "diverse perspectives" of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic. Choice A is incorrect. "Procient" means "skilled." Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different styles; they’re not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. "Ambiguous" means "unclear" or "open to multiple interpretations." However, it’s actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations ("diverse perspectives"). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to "diverge" from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and rm (a "unied vision"). Choice D is incorrect. "Unpretentious" means "not trying to impress others with greater skill or importance than is actually possessed."

      "“How lifelike are they?” Many computer animators prioritize this question as they strive to create ever more realistic environments and lighting. Generally, while characters in computer-animated lms appear highly exaggerated, environments and lighting are carefully engineered to mimic reality. But some animators, such as Pixar’s Sanjay Patel, are focused on a different question. Rather than asking rst whether the environments and lighting they’re creating are convincingly lifelike, Patel and others are asking whether these elements reect their lms’ unique stories. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole?",
    optionA:
      "A. It reects a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce.",
    optionB:
      "B. It represents a concern of computer animators who are more interested in creating unique backgrounds and lighting effects than realistic ones.",

    optionD:
      "D. It illustrates a reaction that audiences typically have to the appearance of characters created by computer animators.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole. The text begins with the underlined question, “How lifelike are they?” The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated lms, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren’t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reect the lm’s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reect lms’ unique stories and aren’t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience’s reactions to characters in animated lms.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to summarize a nding suggesting that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects resemble mechanisms in mammalian brains. The text begins by explaining that feelings such as pleasure and displeasure are linked to chemical processes in the brain, such as the release of dopamine when one receives a reward. The text then indicates that such processes have been seen in mammals but that researchers have recently observed similar processes involving dopamine in honeybees. Taken together, this information serves to sum up the discovery that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects may resemble mechanisms linked to feelings such as pleasure and displeasure in mammals. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe any experiments or experimental methods. Instead, the text describes a phenomenon that has been observed in mammals and then presents the recent observations of Huang and colleagues that this phenomenon is also seen in honeybees. Choice B is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that certain insects can express how they’re feeling through particular processes. The text does indicate that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine, but it doesn’t suggest that these behaviors enable honeybees to communicate feelings or sensations. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents research showing that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine and therefore may be motivated by similar mechanisms to those in mammalian brains, not that honeybees and mammals behave similarly when there is the possibility of reward for their actions.",

    optionA: "A. reduced",
    optionB: "B. evaluated",
    optionC: "C. determined",
    optionD: "D. acquired",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how the ow of information between two regions of the brain may affect the ease of people’s decision making. In this context, "reduced" means decreased. The text presents the nding from a team of neuroeconomists that decision making may be connected to communication between the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. In presenting this nding, the text suggests a contrast between people who tend to be more decisive and people who make decisions more slowly. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the ow of information between the two brain regions is intensied, or strengthened. On the other hand, this context suggests that people make choices more slowly when the ow of information between the two brain regions is decreased. Choice B is incorrect because "evaluated" means assessed, which wouldn’t make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the ow of information between two brain regions is intensied, or strengthened. This suggests that people’s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to assess the information. Choice C is incorrect because "determined" means judged or inuenced, neither of which would make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the ow of information between two brain regions is intensied, or strengthened. This suggests that people’s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to judge or inuence the information. Choice D is incorrect because "acquired" means developed or attained, neither of which would make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the ow of information between two brain regions is intensied, or strengthened. This suggests that people’s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on the development or attainment of the information.',

Economist Trevon Logan showed, however, that a close look at the available data disproves this supposition. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. surmised",
    optionB: "B. contrived",
    optionC: "C. questioned",
    optionD: "D. regretted",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century household food purchases. In this context, “surmised” means formed an idea or assumption with little evidence. The text explains that certain economic historians “assumed” that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, “contrived” would mean brought about or created through trickery. Nothing in the text suggests that the economic historians were deliberately trying to trick people with a claim about food purchasing behaviors in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households; the text simply suggests that they made an assumption about those behaviors that another historian believes isn’t supported by the available data. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that it’s Logan and not the economic historians who “questioned,” or doubted, the assumption that large and small households in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries spent different amounts on food per person; the economic historians are the ones who made that assumption to begin with. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians “regretted,” or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households. The text focuses on the idea that the economic historians made an assumption about those behaviors that may not be supported by available data, not on the historians’ emotional response to what households did in the past.",

The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness. As used in the text, what does the word “disturbed” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Disorganized",
    optionB: "B. Alarmed",
    optionC: "C. Offended",
    optionD: "D. Interrupted",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, “disturbed” most nearly means alarmed. The text portrays the narrator traveling in a carriage as wolves howl in the surrounding darkness. The text contrasts the reaction of both the narrator and the horses pulling the carriage with that of the driver of the carriage: the narrator and horses are “dreadfully afraid,” but the driver is “not in the least disturbed.” In other words, the driver is not alarmed by the wolves nearby. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean disorganized, the text doesn’t portray a character acting in a disorganized manner; instead, the driver continues to drive the carriage, even though the horses pulling it are alarmed. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean offended, the text doesn’t portray one character feeling offended, or upset, by another’s actions; instead, it contrasts the fear felt by the narrator with another character’s lack of fear. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean interrupted, the text doesn’t portray an action being interrupted; indeed, the travel depicted in the scene continues despite the threat of the wolves outside the carriage.",

This suggests that nuisance costs are not linked to donation size. Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t t the logic of the text.

      "B. It indicates that Shakti has lost her sense of direction in the woods.",
    optionC: "C. It emphasizes Shakti’s sense of belonging in the landscape.",
    optionD:
      "D. It conveys Shakti’s appreciation for her long-term friendships.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence of the text states that Shakti knows the woods she is walking in well. The next sentence, which is underlined, emphasizes Shakti’s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods by describing how the tree branches are friendly and “welcoming,” as they are depicted as extending open arms to her. The remainder of the text also shows that Shakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as “an old friend” of the trees. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to emphasize Shakti’s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits. Choice A is incorrect because the text and underlined portion suggest that Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, in her surroundings: the trees around her are described as welcoming and reassuring. Moreover, the underlined portion discusses Shakti’s feelings in the forest, not the river, since she hasn’t reached the river yet. Choice B is incorrect because the text and underlined portion emphasize Shakti’s familiarity with the woods. The trees are inviting, and she feels like “an old friend” to the woods, so she isn’t lost or confused there. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence uses the phrase “as an old friend” guratively in reference to Shakti’s sense of familiarity with the landscape, not in reference to her long-standing friendships with other people, and the text and underlined portion never discuss her feelings about such friendships.",

    optionA: "A. waive",
    optionB: "B. concede",
    optionC: "C. refute",
    optionD: "D. require",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the signicance of the 2014 archaeological nding at El Algar. In this context, “concede” means to admit something is true after rst resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe “Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.” But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included “valuable objects signaling a high position of power,” which would raise the possibility that “women may have also held leadership roles.” Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion. Choice A is incorrect because “waive” means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn’t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text. Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the nding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, “refute” means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team’s nding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “require” means to demand or specify as mandatory. However, it would not make sense for contemporary researchers to demand that Bronze Age “women may have also held leadership roles.”",

The experimental group spent a few minutes writing about one of their personal values before they had a group discussion on a controversial topic. And the control group spent a few minutes writing about a drink (tea, milk, etc.) before their group discussion on that topic.

    optionD:
      "D. To explain a study’s conclusion and how a research team arrived at that conclusion",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain a study’s conclusion and how researchers involved in the study arrived at that conclusion. The text begins by summarizing the main conclusion of the study conducted by Paul Hanel and colleagues: when confronted with ideas they disagree with in discussions about controversial topics, people are more likely to respond politely if they think about their personal values before engaging in such discussions. The text then goes on to describe the design of Hanel and colleagues’ experiment. By comparing interactions between members of an experimental group (who had been prompted to write about their personal values beforehand) to those between members of a control group (who had been prompted to write about a beverage), the team found that people in the experimental group behaved more civilly, or politely, than people in the control group did during discussions about a controversial topic. This nding led to the conclusion described at the beginning of the text. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses the results of a study, it doesn’t provide any indication that the conclusion the study supported—that when facing disagreement, people behave more politely when they have thought about their values—is a belief that is widely held. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that the researchers found the results of their study to be surprising, or contrary to what they expected. In fact, there’s no indication provided in the text about how the researchers felt about the study’s results or that the results should be considered surprising. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text discusses the experimental design of a study, it doesn’t suggest any improvements to that design; instead, it focuses on how the design enabled the researchers to draw a particular conclusion.",

Many women hoped for better employment opportunities in the North because, in the South, they faced much competition for domestic employment and men tended to get agricultural work. To aid with this transition, Barrier Williams helped secure job placement in the North for many women before they even began their journey. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",

    optionD:
      "D. To provide an overview of the employment challenges faced by Black women in the agricultural and domestic spheres in the southern United States",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the text’s purpose, which is to discuss the important role Barrier Williams played in supporting many other Black women as they relocated to the northern United States during the early years of the Great Migration. After introducing Barrier Williams, the text describes how she helped nd jobs for other Black women, who in many cases relocated in search of better employment prospects than the South could offer at the time. The text indicates that by doing so, she eased these women’s transition as their circumstances changed. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions Barrier Williams’s work as a political activist and writer for the Chicago Defender, it doesn’t discuss any professional connections she made in these roles or indicate that she used any such connections in her work to secure employment for other Black women. Choice C is incorrect.

      "Text 1 In 1916, H. Dugdale Sykes disputed claims that The Two Noble Kinsmen was coauthored by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher. Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious—Fletcher had a distinct style in his other plays, so much so that lines with that style were considered sucient evidence of Fletcher’s authorship. But for the lines not deemed to be by Fletcher, Sykes felt that their depiction of women indicated that their author was not Shakespeare but Philip Massinger. Text 2 Scholars have accepted The Two Noble Kinsmen as coauthored by Shakespeare since the 1970s: it appears in all major one-volume editions of Shakespeare’s complete works. Though scholars disagree about who wrote what exactly, it is generally held that on the basis of style, Shakespeare wrote all of the rst act and most of the last, while John Fletcher authored most of the three middle acts. Based on the texts, both Sykes in Text 1 and the scholars in Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?",

    optionD:
      "D. Philip Massinger’s style in the rst and last acts of The Two Noble Kinsmen is an homage to Shakespeare’s style.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. Text 1 states that Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious because he had a distinct style in his other plays. Text 2 states that scholars generally agree “on the basis of style” that Fletcher wrote most of the three middle acts.

    optionD: "D. Speculated",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “assumed” most nearly means acquired, or came to possess. The text portrays a character named Drowne carving a gure out of wood. At rst “irregular and misty,” or haphazard and indistinct, the gure’s outline gradually showed “distincter grace and beauty” until the general design of the carved object “was now obvious to the common eye,” or plainly recognizable to anyone.

Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “assumed” can mean acknowledged, or recognized, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden gure can’t acknowledge its own precision. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wooden gure merely imitated, or mimicked, precision. Rather, the text suggests that as Drowne carved his wooden gure, it gradually became more precise. Choice D is incorrect.

    optionB: "B. adjusted",
    optionC: "C. featured",
    optionD: "D. recommended",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ester Hernandez’s art. In this context, "featured" means shown prominently. The text focuses on where Hernandez’s works have been and continue to be displayed, explaining that her early works, which consisted of murals, could be viewed in outdoor spaces in San Francisco. The central contrast developed in the text is between where her early works could be viewed and where her works can be viewed now, which is in museums across the United States and around the world. The context therefore supports the idea that Hernandez’s works are now shown, or featured, in museums globally. Choice A is incorrect because in this context "invented" would mean created something for the rst time, which isn’t supported since the text doesn’t discuss where Hernandez creates her works or whether they’re original or innovative. Choice B is incorrect because "adjusted" in this context would mean adapted. Although the text mentions that many of Hernandez’s early works were outdoor murals and thus it may be reasonable to infer that Hernandez altered her approach to creating art so that her works could be displayed in indoor venues instead, the text makes no mention of how Hernandez’s works might have been adapted for such venues. The text focuses on where Hernandez’s works have been and continue to be displayed, not on how she or anyone else may have adapted, or adjusted, her works. Choice D is incorrect because "recommended" in this context would mean endorsed or put forth as a suggestion for something that is worth seeing. Although it may be reasonable to say that in choosing to display certain works, museum curators believe such works are worth seeing, the text doesn’t discuss the reasons why museums display Hernandez’s works.

    question:
      "Astronomers are condent that the star Betelgeuse will eventually consume all the helium in its core and explode in a supernova. They are much less condent, however, about when this will happen, since that depends on internal characteristics of Betelgeuse that are largely unknown. Astrophysicist Sarana El-Badry Nance and colleagues recently investigated whether acoustic waves in the star could be used to determine internal stellar states but concluded that this method could not suciently reveal Betelgeuse’s internal characteristics to allow its evolutionary state to be rmly xed. Which choice best describes the function of the second sentence in the overall structure of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. It describes a serious limitation of the method used by Nance and colleagues.",
    optionB:
      "B. It presents the central nding reported by Nance and colleagues.",
    optionC:
      "C. It identies the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but did not.",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the second sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence establishes something astronomers believe with some certainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a supernova. The second sentence then introduces a problem: astronomers aren’t certain when Betelgeuse will explode because they don’t have enough information about the star’s internal characteristics. Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarana El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse’s internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn’t be sucient. Thus, the function of the second sentence is to identify the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but didn’t. Choice A is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not a serious limitation of how Nance and colleagues tried to solve it. It is the third sentence that introduces Nance and colleagues, but no serious limitation of their approach to studying a method of determining internal stellar states is described. Choice B is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not the central nding they ultimately reported. It is the third sentence that presents Nance and colleagues’ conclusion that a potential method for determining internal stellar states would be insucient. Choice D is incorrect because the second sentence doesn’t indicate how other astronomers or astrophysicists responded to the work done by Nance and colleagues; the text doesn’t address this information at all.",

      "Archeological excavation of Market Street Chinatown, a nineteenth-century Chinese American community in San Jose, California, provided the rst evidence that Asian food products were imported to the United States in the 1800s: bones from a freshwater sh species native to Southeast Asia. Jinshanzhuang—Hong Kong– based import/export rms—likely coordinated the sh’s transport from Chinese-operated sheries in Vietnam and Malaysia to North American markets. This route reveals the (often overlooked) multinational dimensions of the trade networks linking Chinese diaspora communities.

Choice A is incorrect. The underlined sentence never suggests that the countries of origin of the sh are in question—in fact, it tells us exactly where they came from. Choice C is incorrect. The passage never describes the steps taken to discover the sh bones described in the previous sentence. Choice D is incorrect.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ochoa’s prediction that humans will one day need to live in places other than Earth. As used in this context, “speculates” would mean puts forward an idea without rm evidence. The text states that Ochoa “doesn’t have a denite idea” about when humans might need to live in other environments and characterizes Ochoa’s prediction as a “conjecture,” or a conclusion presented without convincing evidence. This context indicates that Ochoa speculates when she makes this prediction. Choice A is incorrect because saying that Ochoa “demands,” or insists or requires, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context. The text indicates that she’s unsure about the timing but hypothesizes that it will someday happen. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Ochoa “doubts,” or questions or disbelieves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context. The text indicates that although Ochoa is unsure about the timing, she hypothesizes that humans will need to live in places other than Earth and encourages research into future travel to the moon. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Ochoa “establishes,” or proves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context.

    optionC: "C. implication",
    optionD: "D. scale",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the W boson. In this context, "scale" means size or extent. The text indicates that recent measurements of the W boson were remarkable because they revealed the subatomic particle’s mass to be much greater ("seven standard deviations higher") than had been expected based on a standard model. This context conveys not only that the measurements differed from predictions but also that the extent of the difference was very large. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that there was a very large difference between the predicted mass and the actual measured mass of the subatomic particle, it doesn’t explain the cause of, or reason behind, that difference. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the measurements of the subatomic particle were notable because they differed from expectations and also because a difference existed between the measurements and what had been predicted; the text would be repeating the idea that there was a difference instead of adding to that idea. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t convey any implications of, or consequences of or conclusions drawn from, the fact that the mass of the subatomic particle differed from expectations; the context indicates only that the actual measured mass was much higher than the predicted mass.',

Thus, election results in countries that require citizens to vote better reect the preferences of the country as a whole. Text 2 Governments in democratic countries function better when more people vote. However, forcing people to vote may have negative consequences. Shane P. Singh and Jason Roy studied what happens when a country requires its citizens to vote. They found that when people feel forced to vote, they tend to spend less time looking for information about their choices when voting. As a result, votes from these voters may not reect their actual preferences. Based on the texts, how would Singh and Roy (Text 2) most likely respond to the research discussed in Text 1?",

    optionB: "B. inexperienced with",
    optionC: "C. skilled in",
    optionD: "D. excited about",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Renata Flores Rivera’s use of Quechua in her music. In this context, “inexperienced with” means not accustomed to. The text indicates that Flores Rivera wanted to promote the Quechua language in her music and overcame a challenge by seeking help with pronunciation from her grandmother and by taking language classes. This context conveys the idea that Flores Rivera was not suciently familiar with Quechua to use it in her music without help. Thus, she was inexperienced with speaking the language, which she addressed by seeking help. Choice A is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as “prepared for”—or ready for—speaking Quechua wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were ready to speak the language, then there would be no challenge. Choice C is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as “skilled in”—meaning good at or capable of—speaking Quechua wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were capable of speaking the language, then there would be no challenge. Choice D is incorrect.

    optionA: "A. repudiates",
    optionB: "B. proclaims",
    optionC: "C. foretells",
    optionD: "D. recants",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Sterlin Harjo’s approach to representing Native characters on television. As used in this context, “repudiates” means rejects or refuses to have anything to do with. The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo’s series Reservation Dogs focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a “rejection” of the typical approach to depicting Native characters. This context thus indicates that Harjo repudiates television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes Harjo’s “rejection” of the typical approach to representing Native characters on television, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo “proclaims,” or declares or arms, television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. Harjo is described as refusing to follow the pattern of depicting Native characters in the distant past, not as proclaiming that pattern. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes television’s tendency to represent Native characters in the distant past as something that is already occurring, not as something that Harjo “foretells,” or predicts will happen in the future. The text is focused on Harjo’s “rejection” of this pattern, not on any predictions he may have about it. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Harjo “recants” something would mean that he withdraws a previously held belief, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo recants television’s tendency to represent Native characters as living in the past. No beliefs previously held by Harjo are mentioned. Additionally, a tendency isn’t a belief and thus isn’t something that can be recanted.",

It was a huge zoo, spread over numberless acres, big enough to require a train to explore it, though it seemed to get smaller as I grew older, train included. ©2001 by Yann Martel As used in the text, what does the word “spread” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Hidden",
    optionB: "B. Discussed",
    optionC: "C. Extended",
    optionD: "D. Coated",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “spread” most nearly means extended. The text states that the zoo is “huge,” that it covers “numberless acres,” and that it is large enough that a train is needed to explore it. Thus, the text’s emphasis on the zoo’s size suggests that the zoo extended, or stretched, over a large area of land. Choice A is incorrect because if the zoo covers “numberless acres,” then it could not reasonably be described as hidden, or concealed from view. Choice B is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the zoo was discussed, or talked about. Rather, the text focuses on the zoo’s large size. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “spread” can mean coated, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because to coat something means to apply a thin layer of a liquid substance, such as oil or paint, to a surface.

    optionA: "A. struggling",
    optionB: "B. benecial",
    optionC: "C. simple",
    optionD: "D. healthy",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of damage to viburnum plants. In this context, “healthy” would mean not distressed or diseased. The text states that insect damage may cause viburnum plants to be discolored and have abnormal growths. In the next sentence, the phrase “on the other hand” indicates a contrast with the description of plants suffering from damage. Thus, the context contrasts the appearance of healthy, undamaged plants with the appearance of damaged plants. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “struggling” would mean working against diculties. The text rst describes viburnum plants experiencing damage by insects, and the phrase “on the other hand” then establishes a contrast with that description. It wouldn’t make sense to contrast struggling viburnum plants with those being damaged by insects, because in both cases the plants would be experiencing diculties. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “benecial” would mean producing good or helpful effects. The text doesn’t discuss how viburnum plants affect other things or suggest that the plants are helpful in some way; rather, it focuses on how viburnum plants are affected by certain conditions.

    optionB: "B. receive",
    optionC: "C. evaluate",
    optionD: "D. mimic",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Moon’s surface. In this context, “reect” means show or make apparent. The text states that because the surface of the Moon was softer when the Moon was still forming than it is now, early asteroid and meteoroid impacts “would have left less of an impression” and, as a result, evidence of them may no longer exist. This context supports the idea that the surface of the Moon may not accurately show signs of early impact events. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately “receive,” or acquire or experience, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids. The text indicates that the impacts have already occurred, and it isn’t clear how the Moon’s surface could be accurate or inaccurate in experiencing them. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately “evaluate,” or determine the signicance or condition of, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids, since that would suggest that it’s possible for the Moon’s surface to make a decision of any kind. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “mimic” would mean to deliberately simulate or closely imitate something.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of noses on ancient sculptures. In this context, "fragile" means weak or delicate. This matches the text’s description of noses on ancient sculptures, which are often missing from sculptures’ heads because they are "especially easy to break." Therefore, this context indicates that noses on ancient sculptures are the most fragile part of the sculptures’ heads. Choice A is incorrect.

      "A. By concurring that the risk described in Text 1 should be evaluated but emphasizing that the risk is more than offset by the potential benets of nanomaterial\nconjugation",
    optionB:
      "B. By arguing that the situation described in Text 1 may not be representative but conceding that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation are harder to predict than\nresearchers had expected",
    optionC:
      "C. By denying that the circumstance described in Text 1 is likely to occur but acknowledging that many aspects of nanomaterial conjugation are still poorly\nunderstood",
    optionD:
      "D. By agreeing that the possibility described in Text 1 is a cause for concern but pointing out that nanomaterial conjugation does not inevitably produce that result",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 acknowledges that nanohybrids may be more toxic than their constituent parts, but also provides an example of a nanohybrid that has reduced toxicity compared to its components: silicon dioxide and zinc oxide together have all the benets of zinc oxide nanoparticles without any of the DNA harm zinc oxide has on its own. Choice A is incorrect. While the author of Text 2 gives an example of a nanohybrid that isn’t as toxic as its constituent parts, they don’t argue that the benet outweighs the risk. They merely argue that “the effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case.” Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 states that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation “vary by case,” and that the attention that their potential toxicity has drawn is warranted. If the situation in Text 1 weren’t representative, then there would be less attention to the potential danger of these materials. Furthermore, neither passage suggests that researchers had expected that they could predict the effects of nanomaterial conjugation. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 agrees that the potential toxicity of nanohybrids “has drawn deserved attention,” so they aren’t denying the problem.",

It then states that the Norman king Roger II hired al-Idrisi to create the collection and details al-Idrisi’s methods of creation: consulting Arabic and Greek maps and interviewing travelers. In short, the text presents a collection of medieval maps and then goes on to describe how that collection came to be. Choice A is incorrect because the text describes a collection of maps and the process of creating that collection but does not discuss the benets of studying mapmaking in general. Choice B is incorrect because though the text mentions that al-Idrisi interviewed travelers, the text does not describe how those travelers created maps. Choice D is incorrect because though the text mentions that al-Idrisi consulted Arabic and Greek maps, the text does not offer a comparison of Arabic and Greek mapmaking techniques.",

      "According to historian Vicki L. Ruiz, Mexican American women made crucial contributions to the labor movement during World War II. At the time, food processing companies entered into contracts to supply United States armed forces with canned goods. Increased production quotas conferred greater bargaining power on the companies’ employees, many of whom were Mexican American women: employees insisted on more favorable benets, and employers, who were anxious to fulll the contracts, complied. Thus, labor activism became a platform for Mexican American women to assert their agency. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",

    optionD:
      "D. It provides further details about the identities of the workers discussed earlier in the text.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The text says that the increased production quotas of food processing companies during World War II enabled employees to make better bargains in exchange for their labor. The underlined portion presents an example of this increased bargaining power: employees requested more favorable benets, and employers complied because they were under pressure to fulll the demanding terms of their contracts. Thus, the underlined portion of the text elaborates on a claim about labor relations in a particular industry (food processing) made earlier in the text. Choice B is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that the economic factors that inuenced food processing also inuenced other parts of the economy; thus, the bargaining described in the underlined portion of the text cannot be called an example of a trend. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion supports the historical narrative of labor activism in food processing that is sketched in the text, instead of noting an exception to that narrative. Choice D is incorrect because while the underlined portion does discuss the demands that workers made in exchange for their labor, it does not discuss the identities of the workers.",

I went on with my day’s business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thorneld; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:

      "B. To emphasize Jane’s loyalty to the people she works for at Thorneld Hall",
    optionC:
      "C. To demonstrate that Jane nds her situation both challenging and deeply fullling",
    optionD:
      "D. To describe Jane’s determination to secure employment outside of Thorneld Hall",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to show that while Jane calmly goes about her daily tasks, she is experiencing internal agitation about possibly seeking a new job. At the start of the text, Jane says, “I went on with my day’s business tranquilly,” indicating that she is outwardly calm. This outward calmness is then contrasted with her intense internal restlessness, as Jane says that thoughts of leaving her job keep running through her mind, that she is “involuntarily framing advertisements” (meaning that she can’t stop herself from thinking up potential listings for jobs), and that she often wonders what new “situations” (or jobs) would be like. Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of Jane’s feelings, either positive or negative, about the people she works for at Thorneld Hall. And rather than emphasizing that Jane feels particularly loyal to her employers, the text focuses on her constant consideration of leaving her job. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Jane nds her current situation fullling, or satisfying. Given that much of the text is focused on Jane’s thoughts about possibly leaving her job for a new one, it might be the case that she nds her situation challenging, but there is no evidence in the text that Jane also nds that situation satisfying—she says nothing positive about her current job at all, in fact. Choice D is incorrect because the text describes Jane as wondering about getting a new job, not as determined to denitely do so. Jane keeps thinking about reasons why she “should” quit her current job (indicating that she hasn’t yet decided to) and imagining possible new situations she could nd, but she says at the end of the text that these thoughts “might germinate and bear fruit if they could,” meaning that the thoughts haven’t yet led to a decision—that Jane isn’t yet determined to get a new job somewhere else.",

Jenkins recognized and took full advantage of this ______ access to powerful technology to create groundbreaking works of video art, such as Mass of Images (1978). Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. newfound",
    optionB: "B. delicate",
    optionC: "C. inevitable",
    optionD: "D. habitual",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ulysses Jenkins’s video art. As used in this context, “newfound” means recently discovered or established. The text indicates that in the 1970s, video cameras became cheaper and therefore more widely available than they had been in the past. The text goes on to say that this development provided Jenkins and other artists with capabilities that they previously didn’t have. As a result, Jenkins began producing groundbreaking works of video art. This context supports the idea that Jenkins took advantage of newfound access to video cameras. Choice B is incorrect because “delicate” means ne in texture or structure or easily broken, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text doesn’t focus on describing what video art looks like or whether it’s breakable. Choice C is incorrect because “inevitable” means impossible to avoid, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text doesn’t discuss the likelihood of artists, or anyone else, gaining access to video cameras. Choice D is incorrect because “habitual” means doing something regularly or repeatedly. Although the text does suggest that Jenkins created multiple pieces of video art, its focus is on the fact that video cameras had only just become widely available to artists in the 1970s. Jenkins’s ability to take advantage of video cameras to make art was therefore newfound, not habitual, at the time.",

      "Text 1 Africa’s Sahara region—once a lush ecosystem—began to dry out about 8,000 years ago. A change in Earth’s orbit that affected climate has been posited as a cause of desertication, but archaeologist David Wright also attributes the shift to Neolithic peoples. He cites their adoption of pastoralism as a factor in the region drying out: the pastoralists’ livestock depleted vegetation, prompting the events that created the Sahara Desert. Text 2 Research by Chris Brierley et al. challenges the idea that Neolithic peoples contributed to the Sahara’s desertication. Using a climate-vegetation model, the team concluded that the end of the region’s humid period occurred 500 years earlier than previously assumed. The timing suggests that Neolithic peoples didn’t exacerbate aridity in the region but, in fact, may have helped delay environmental changes with practices (e.g., selective grazing) that preserved vegetation. Based on the texts, how would Chris Brierley (Text 2) most likely respond to the discussion in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By pointing out that given the revised timeline for the end of the Sahara’s humid period, the Neolithic peoples’ mode of subsistence likely didn’t cause the\nregion’s desertication",
    optionB:
      "B. By claiming that pastoralism was only one of many behaviors the Neolithic peoples took part in that may have contributed to the Sahara’s changing climate",
    optionC:
      "C. By insisting that pastoralism can have both benecial and deleterious effects on a region’s vegetation and climate",
    optionD:
      "D. By asserting that more research needs to be conducted into factors that likely contributed to the desertication of the Sahara region",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. Brierley et al.’s research directly challenges Wright’s claim that pastoralism turned the Sahara into a desert, suggesting that, in a Sahara that turned arid 500 years earlier than previously thought, pastoral practices may have actually “preserved vegetation” rather than depleting it. Choice B is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research actually disputes the idea that any Neolithic peoples’ behaviors, including pastoralism, could have contributed to the Sahara’s changing climate. In fact, their research implies that the Neolithic peoples’ practices did not “exacerbate aridity” (i.e., make things worse), but may have slowed environmental changes. Choice C is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research does not acknowledge that pastoralism can have deleterious (i.e., negative) effects on a region’s vegetation and climate. It only describes one possible benecial effect: preserving vegetation through practices like selective grazing. Choice D is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research does not call for more research into factors that likely contributed to the desertication of the Sahara region.",

    optionC: "C. It makes a claim that is challenged in the text.",
    optionD: "D. It presents a hypothesis that is evaluated in the text.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the rst sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence introduces what yawn contagion is, explaining that it occurs when an individual yawns in response to the yawn of another individual. The text goes on to describe Elisabetta Palagi and her colleagues’ study of this phenomenon in a wild population of gelada monkeys. According to the text, the study showed that wild primate populations experience yawn contagion and that the behavior occurs most commonly in male monkeys and across social groups. Thus, the function of the rst sentence is to dene the phenomenon of yawn contagion that is discussed in the text. Choice B is incorrect. Although the rst sentence introduces the text’s discussion of yawn contagion, it doesn’t present this behavior, or anything else, as a problem.

    optionA: "A. awkward",
    optionB: "B. imaginative",
    optionC: "C. manageable",
    optionD: "D. competent",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of self-control in cuttlesh. In this context, "competent" means capable. The text describes a study in which cuttlesh demonstrated an ability to exercise restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of eating a meal that was already available to them. That is, by delaying gratication, the cuttlesh in the study demonstrated that they were capable of, or competent at, exercising self-control. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that in demonstrating self-control, cuttlesh are "awkward," or lacking skill or grace. If anything, the text indicates that cuttlesh appear to be surprisingly skilled at exercising self-control. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "imaginative" would mean creative, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that cuttlesh demonstrate creativity. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that cuttlesh seem to be capable of exercising restraint and self-control. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "manageable" would mean capable of being controlled. Although the text indicates that the cuttlesh in the study demonstrated restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of devouring a readily available meal (which suggests their ability to control themselves), it doesn’t suggest that cuttlesh are thus also able to be managed or controlled by others.',

In 2007, to dene the pure umami avor scientists Rie Ishii and Michael O’Mahony used broths made from shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed, and two panels of Japanese and US judges closely agreed on a description of the taste. Text 2 A 2022 experiment by Manon Jünger et al. led to a greater understanding of soy sauce’s avor prole. The team initially presented a mixture of compounds with low molecular weights to taste testers who found it was not as salty or bitter as real soy sauce. Further analysis of soy sauce identied proteins, including dipeptides, that enhanced umami avor and also contributed to saltiness. The team then made a mix of 50 chemical compounds that re-created soy sauce’s avor. Based on the texts, if Ishii and O’Mahony (Text 1) and Jünger et al.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. Ishii and O’Mahony were trying to isolate the pure umami avor, while Jünger was trying to recreate soy sauce, which has a mix of avors that includes umami. Accordingly, the broths from Text 1 are not described as having any soy sauce in them—just “shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed.” So they probably don’t have as much of the dipeptides described in Text 2, which were found to be a key part of soy sauce’s umami-ness and its saltiness. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Neither text gets into the diets of people in the United States, nor the diets of people in Japan. Choice B is incorrect.

    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Olga Tokarczuk’s novel The Books of Jacob. As used in this context, “complexity” means having many complicated parts that when taken as a whole are dicult to follow or explain. The text indicates that The Books of Jacob has a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is dicult to follow), and reverse page numbering. Together, these features make up a novel that’s challenging to read and summarize. This context supports the idea that a brief book review can’t do justice to the novel’s complexity. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word “accuracy,” or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be used to describe a novel, the text doesn’t discuss whether Tokarczuk’s novel has this quality. Instead, the text describes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a dicult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering. These features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because “inactivity” means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text describes Tokarczuk’s novel, and although it’s possible the novel could portray its characters as inactive, it wouldn’t make sense to describe the novel itself as such. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “restraint” would mean holding back or showing self-control, and the text doesn’t indicate that Tokarczuk’s novel has either of these qualities.

    question:
      "Text 1 Microbes are tiny organisms in the soil, water, and air all around us. They thrive even in very harsh conditions. That’s why Noah Fierer and colleagues were surprised when soil samples they collected from an extremely cold, dry area in Antarctica didn’t seem to contain any life. The nding doesn’t prove that there are no microbes in that area, but the team says it does suggest that the environment severely restricts microbes’ survival. Text 2 Microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth. So it’s unlikely they would be completely absent from Fierer’s team’s study site, no matter how extreme the environment is. There were probably so few organisms in the samples that current technology couldn’t detect them. But since a spoonful of typical soil elsewhere might contain billions of microbes, the presence of so few in the Antarctic soil samples would show how challenging the conditions are. Based on the texts, Fierer’s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about microbes?",
    optionA:
      "A. Most microbes are better able to survive in environments with extremely dry conditions than in environments with harsh temperatures.",
    optionB:
      "B. A much higher number of microbes would probably be found if another sample of soil were taken from the Antarctic study site.",
    optionC:
      "C. Microbes are likely dicult to detect in the soil at the Antarctic study site because they tend to be smaller than microbes found in typical soil elsewhere.",
    optionD:
      "D. Most microbes are probably unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer’s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer’s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn’t appear to contain any life. Fierer’s team says that though this doesn’t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably dicult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it’s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer’s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it dicult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer’s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer’s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer’s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn’t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer’s team wouldn’t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn’t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer’s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn’t detect them, but the author doesn’t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer’s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples.",

      "The following text is from Nella Larsen’s 1928 novel Quicksand. The trees in their spring beauty sent through her restive mind a sharp thrill of pleasure. Seductive, charming, and beckoning as cities were, they had not this easy unhuman loveliness. As used in the text, what does the word “beckoning” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Demanding",
    optionB: "B. Signaling",
    optionC: "C. Inviting",
    optionD: "D. Shifting",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “beckoning” most nearly means “inviting,” or attractive. The text portrays a woman who is looking at “trees in their spring beauty.” She compares them to cities, which have their own pleasures even if they do not have the “easy unhuman loveliness” of trees: she thinks of cities as “seductive” and “charming,” both adjectives that signify something that is enticing, or attractive. Therefore, cities that are seductive and charming would also be described as inviting people closer to them. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in this context that cities are “demanding,” or requiring effort. Choice B is incorrect. Though “signaling,” or communicating something, might be considered a key feature of the act of “beckoning,” in the context here, “beckoning” suggests that cities have attractive qualities that naturally draw people to them. Such attractive qualities are not described by the word “signaling” alone. Therefore, “signaling” is an incorrect answer because it is insuciently precise. Choice D is incorrect because there is no reason to think in this context that the cities are “shifting,” or changing shape.",

    question:
      "Text 1 Historians studying pre-Inca Peru have looked to ceramic vessels to understand daily life among the Moche people. These mold-made sculptures present plants, animals, and human faces in precise ways—vessels representing human faces are so detailed that scholars have interpreted facial markings to represent scars and other skin irregularities. Some historians have even used these objects to identify potential skin diseases that may have aicted people at the time. Text 2 Art historian and archaeologist Lisa Trever has argued that the interpretation of Moche “portrait” vessels as hyper-realistic portrayals of identiable people may inadvertently disregard the creativity of the objects’ creators. Moche ceramic vessels, Trever argues, are artworks in which sculptors could free their imagination, using realistic objects and people around them as inspiration to explore more abstract concepts. Based on the texts, what would Lisa Trever (Text 2) most likely say about the interpretation presented in the underlined portion of Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. Depictions of human faces are signicantly more realistic than depictions of plants and other animals are.",
    optionB:
      "B. It is likely that some depictions of human faces with extensive markings are intended to portray the same historical individual.",
    optionC:
      "C. Some vessels may have been damaged during their excavation and thus provide little insight into Moche culture.",
    optionD:
      "D. Markings on depictions of human faces are not necessarily intended to portray particular details about the physical appearance of individuals.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. Trever thinks that the “hyper-realistic portrayal of identiable people” interpretation ignores the sculptors’ imagination and creativity. We can infer that Trevor thinks the facial markings on the sculptures may not have represented real skin blemishes on real people. Choice A is incorrect. The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. Neither text compares the depictions of human faces to the depictions of plants or animals, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion. Choice B is incorrect. The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. There’s nothing in either text about multiple depictions representing the same person, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion. Choice C is incorrect. The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. Neither text mentions the state of the vessels (damaged or intact), so we have no basis to draw this conclusion.",

    optionC: "C. spans",
    optionD: "D. advances",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. “Spans” means “extends over a distance of” or “encompasses.” Since we’re talking about the world’s largest plant, it makes sense to say that it “spans” about 200 square kilometers. Choice A is incorrect. “Acknowledges” means “recognizes” or “admits the truth of.” Either way, it doesn’t make sense here: a plant can’t “acknowledge” a distance. Choice B is incorrect. “Produces” can mean “makes,” “causes,” or “presents.” But none of those denitions make sense here: a plant can’t make, cause, or present a distance. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn’t t the logic of the text. “Advances” means “moves forward” or “progresses.” But the plant isn’t necessarily moving forward.

Turning away from landscapes painted in an expressionist style—a style that often involves using uid, distorted shapes and thick, textured brushstrokes to express the artist’s subjective experience of reality—Johnson began painting portraits of Black Americans in a bold new way. Evocative of African sculpture and American and Scandinavian folk art, these portraits feature at, deliberately oversimplied gures in a vibrant but limited color palette.

    optionD:
      "D. It presents evidence that calls into question the previous sentence’s characterization of Johnson’s artistic development.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole. The rst sentence of the text indicates that Johnson returned to the US in 1938 at which time his painting style suddenly changed. The second sentence is underlined and gives more detail about this stylistic change, noting that his earlier work consisted largely of landscapes in an expressionist style and his new works were highly stylized portraits of Black Americans. In other words, the function of the underlined sentence is to elaborate on a transitional moment in Johnson’s painting career. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does mention that Johnson spent a decade in Europe, it does not discuss what other travel Johnson might have done. Furthermore, although the text mentions African, American, and Scandinavian artistic elements in Johnson’s work, it does not indicate that he traveled to different locations to learn about these practices. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not focus on Johnson’s personal life nor does it address how successful his career was in general.

He hired himself out for three months; at the end of that time to receive for his wages two hundred acres of land lying in New Hampshire. [...] His employer proving false to the contract in the matter of the land, and there being no law in the country to force him to full it, Israel—who, however brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch, seems nevertheless to have evinced, throughout many parts of his career, a singular patience and mildness—was obliged to look round for other means of livelihood than clearing out a farm for himself in the wilderness.

      "C. It shows why Israel would not have been able to undertake the enormous amount of labor necessary to run a farm even if he had owned the necessary property.",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months’ work, but his employer then refused to fulll the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to nd another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer’s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was "brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch," he also possessed "a singular patience and mildness." In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of. Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm. Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel’s personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel’s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sucient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text—that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.',

Because it represented the sounds of spoken Cherokee so accurately, his script was easy to learn and thus quickly achieved ______ use: by 1830, over 90 percent of the Cherokee people could read and write it. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. widespread",
    optionB: "B. careful",
    optionC: "C. unintended",
    optionD: "D. infrequent",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the writing system created by Sequoyah. In this context, “widespread” means widely accepted or practiced. The text indicates that because Sequoyah’s script accurately represented the spoken sounds of the Cherokee language and was easy to learn, nearly all Cherokee people were able to read and write it soon after it was created. This context demonstrates that the script was widely used by the Cherokee people. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, “careful” would mean exercised with care and attentive concern. Although the work of creating a writing system likely involved great care, the text indicates that the system was “easy to learn,” which conicts with the idea that using this system requires a noteworthy amount of care. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “unintended” means not deliberate. The idea that using Sequoyah’s script was unintentional conicts directly with the claim that it was easy to learn and used by “over 90% of the Cherokee people” by 1830. In fact, because one had to learn this system, it’s not clear how one could use it unintentionally. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “infrequent” means rare or not occurring often, which conicts directly with the claim that “over 90% of the Cherokee people” were using Sequoyah’s script by 1830.",

    question:
      "Text 1 Italian painters in the 1500s rarely depicted themselves in their work. Even more rare were self-portrait paintings that portrayed the artist as a painter. At the time, painting was not yet respected as a profession, so painters mostly chose to emphasize other qualities in their self-portraits, like their intellect or social status. In the city of Bologna, the rst artist to depict themself painting was a man named Annibale Carracci. A painting of his from around 1585 shows Carracci in front of an easel holding a palette. Text 2 In their self-portraits, Bolognese artists typically avoided referring to the act of painting until the mid-1600s. However, Lavinia Fontana’s 1577 painting, Self-Portrait at the Keyboard, stands out as the earliest example of such a work by an artist from Bologna. Although the artist is depicted playing music, in the background, one can spot a painting easel by a window. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. Carracci and Fontana were among the most well-respected painters in Bologna at the time.",
    optionB:
      "B. The depiction of Fontana in Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was intended to underscore the artist’s creativity.",
    optionC:
      "C. Fontana likely inspired the reference to an easel and palette in Carracci’s painting.",
    optionD:
      "D. Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was painted earlier than Carracci’s painting and also refers to the artist’s craft.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 states that Fontana’s painting, which depicts a painting easel in the background, was made in 1577, eight years before Carracci’s painting. Therefore, they might argue that Caracci was not “the rst artist” to depict themself as a painter. Choice A is incorrect. The texts don’t support this choice. Neither text mentions the reputation or status of either Carracci or Fontana. Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does not comment on the intention or meaning of Fontana’s self-depiction in Self-Portrait at the Keyboard. This choice also holds little connection to the underlined claim. Choice C is incorrect. The texts don’t support this choice. The author of Text 2 does not suggest any inspirational relationship between Fontana and Carracci.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about recycling plastics. In this context, “inadequate” means not satisfactory. The text indicates that the mechanical plastic-recycling process affects the environment and causes “the loss of material quality.” The text contrasts that with Chazovachii’s chemical plastic-recycling process, which is cleaner and produces a desirable product. The text’s emphasis on the negative aspects of mechanical recycling suggests that it is inadequate in terms of environmental impact and the quality of the material the process yields. Choice A is incorrect because in this context “resilient” would mean able to withstand diculty and the text does not characterize the plastic-recycling process as having this quality or describe any diculties that these processes might need to overcome. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “dynamic” would mean constantly changing. Although the text suggests that there have been changes in the eld of recycling, as is the case with the advent of Chazovachii’s chemical recycling process, there is nothing to suggest that the mechanical process itself has changed or is prone to change. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “satisfactory” would mean acceptable but not perfect.

    question:
      "Bioluminescent beetles called reies may seem to create ashes of light randomly, but each species of rey actually has its own special series of repeated ashes and pauses. These unique ______ allow reies of the same species to nd each other. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. quantities",
    optionB: "B. decorations",
    optionC: "C. patterns",
    optionD: "D. agreements",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the ashes created by reies. In this context, “patterns” means distinct and predictable sequences. The text indicates that although the ashes that reies produce appear to occur randomly—that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm—each species actually produces its own special series of ashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of ashes are so unique that reies can use them to nd other members of their species. Therefore, this context supports the idea that reies produce ashes in distinct and recognizable patterns. Choice A is incorrect because “quantities” means certain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text discusses how different rey species produce ashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other members of their species to nd them, it doesn’t mention the number of ashes that are used in these sequences. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “decorations” would mean things that make an object more beautiful. Although it may be reasonable to say that rey ashes are beautiful, the text focuses on the fact that reies use these unique sequences of ashes to nd other members of their own species, not that the ashes make reies more beautiful. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “agreements” would refer to deals that individuals have discussed and come to a consensus about. Since reies aren’t capable of making such agreements, it wouldn’t make sense to use this word to refer to the signals they send each other with their ashes.",

    question:
      "Text 1 Astronomer Mark Holland and colleagues examined four white dwarfs—small, dense remnants of past stars—in order to determine the composition of exoplanets that used to orbit those stars. Studying wavelengths of light in the white dwarf atmospheres, the team reported that traces of elements such as lithium and sodium support the presence of exoplanets with continental crusts similar to Earth’s. Text 2 Past studies of white dwarf atmospheres have concluded that certain exoplanets had continental crusts. Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer Siyi Xu argue that those studies unduly emphasize atmospheric traces of lithium and other individual elements as signiers of the types of rock found on Earth. The studies don’t adequately account for different minerals made up of various ratios of those elements, and the possibility of rock types not found on Earth that contain those minerals. Based on the texts, how would Putirka and Xu (Text 2) most likely characterize the conclusion presented in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. As unexpected, because it was widely believed at the time that white dwarf exoplanets lack continental crusts",
    optionB:
      "B. As premature, because researchers have only just begun trying to determine what kinds of crusts white dwarf exoplanets had",
    optionC:
      "C. As questionable, because it rests on an incomplete consideration of potential sources of the elements detected in white dwarf atmospheres",
    optionD:
      "D. As puzzling, because it’s unusual to successfully detect lithium and sodium when analyzing wavelengths of light in white dwarf atmospheres",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it reects how Putirka and Xu (Text 2) would likely characterize the conclusion presented in Text 1. Text 1 discusses a study by Mark Holland and colleagues in which they detected traces of lithium and sodium in the atmospheres of four white dwarf stars. The team claims that this supports the idea that exoplanets with continental crusts like Earth’s once orbited these stars. Text 2 introduces Putirka and Xu, who indicate that sodium and lithium are present in several different minerals and that some of those minerals might exist in types of rock that are not found on Earth. Therefore, Putirka and Xu would likely describe the conclusion in Text 1 as questionable because it does not consider that lithium and sodium are also found in rocks that are not like Earth’s continental crust. Choice A is incorrect because the texts do not indicate how widely held any of the viewpoints described are. Choice B is incorrect because neither text discusses how new this area of study is. Choice D is incorrect because neither text discusses how likely lithium and sodium are to be detected by analyzing wavelengths of light.",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. selects",
    optionB: "B. originates",
    optionC: "C. conditions",
    optionD: "D. replenishes",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Indigenous method of harvesting Hierochloe odorata. As used in this context, “replenishes” means helps increase the population or helps it recover. The text explains that although snapping off a wild plant at the root might seem detrimental to the wild population, it actually helps Hierochloe odorata, increasing both their “number and vigor.” This context conveys the idea that even though it seems counterintuitive, the Indigenous method of harvesting Hierochloe odorata actually replenishes the wild population. Choice A is incorrect. Although a harvesting method could be used to select for certain traits in plants, it’s not clear what it would mean for a harvesting method to select “wild populations” of plants. Choice B is incorrect because as used in this context, “originates” means creates. The text doesn’t address the origin of Hierochloe odorata, but rather how the Indigenous harvesting method affects it. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, “conditions” means to inuence someone or something to behave in a certain way, and the text doesn’t suggest the new plants that replace the harvested ones differ in any meaningful way, or in any way that could be the result of conditioning.",

    optionC: "C. anticipating",
    optionD: "D. reinforcing",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. Based on the text, we’re looking for a word that means something similar to "mak[ing] use of insights and techniques from all those elds." "Transcending" means "going beyond," so "transcending traditional boundaries" would mean crossing into all those various elds of research, which is exactly the meaning we want. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t a logical word choice. Based on the text, we’re looking for a word that means something similar to "mak[ing] use of insights and techniques from all those elds."

Players use a wooden stick to scrape along ridges cut into the side of the gourd, creating sounds that are highly ______: the sounds produced by güiros can differ based on the distance between the ridges, the types of strokes the player uses, and the thickness of the gourd. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. overlooked",
    optionB: "B. powerful",
    optionC: "C. routine",
    optionD: "D. variable",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the sounds made by güiros. In this context, “variable” means able to change. The text begins by explaining that güiros are instruments made out of hollowed gourds with ridges cut into their sides and that players scrape the ridges with wooden sticks to produce sounds. The text goes on to say that güiros’ sounds can change depending on gourd thickness, the distance between ridges, and the types of strokes the player uses, thus supporting the idea that the sounds created by these instruments are variable. Choice A is incorrect because “overlooked” means not being seen or noticed, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are overlooked or not noticed. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “powerful” would mean having a great ability to produce an effect. While it’s possible that the sounds produced by güiros have a strong effect on listeners, the text doesn’t discuss this aspect of their sounds. Choice C is incorrect because “routine” means usual and unvarying, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are unvarying.

      "Some studies have suggested that posture can inuence cognition, but we should not overstate this phenomenon. A case in point: In a 2014 study, Megan O’Brien and Alaa Ahmed had subjects stand or sit while making risky simulated economic decisions. Standing is more physically unstable and cognitively demanding than sitting; accordingly, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that standing subjects would display more risk aversion during the decision-making tasks than sitting subjects did, since they would want to avoid further feelings of discomfort and complicated risk evaluations. But O’Brien and Ahmed actually found no difference in the groups’ performance. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. It argues that research ndings about the effects of posture on cognition are often misunderstood, as in the case of O’Brien and Ahmed’s study.",
    optionB:
      "B. It presents the study by O’Brien and Ahmed to critique the methods and results reported in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition.",
    optionC:
      "C. It explains a signicant problem in the emerging understanding of posture’s effects on cognition and how O’Brien and Ahmed tried to solve that problem.",
    optionD:
      "D. It discusses the study by O’Brien and Ahmed to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about the effects of posture on cognition.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as a "case in point" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same—posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O’Brien and Ahmed’s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture’s effects on cognition. Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research ndings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture and cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O’Brien and Ahmed’s study is not one of those studies, and there is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O’Brien and Ahmed’s ndings. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture’s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O’Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem. O’Brien and Ahmed are presented as hypothesizing that posture would affect cognition in their study, not as trying to resolve the problem the text describes.',

    optionD:
      "D. The speaker examines her surroundings, then speculates about their inuence on her emotional state.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. First, the speaker describes observing a “most beautiful” sight: a tree (“black cypress”) standing out from the golden sky behind it, looking like a person’s nger “pointing upwards” and appearing “sensitive” and “exquisite.” Then the speaker wonders about the image’s meaning, asking why the nger is black and why it’s pointing upward. Thus, the text moves from the speaker’s description of a distinctive sight in nature to her pondering about what meaning to attribute to that sight. Choice A is incorrect because the speaker assesses a natural sight—a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed nger—but doesn’t question the accuracy of her own assessment. Although she wonders why the nger, which is really a tree, is black and why it’s pointing, the speaker doesn’t suggest that her belief that the tree resembles a nger is wrong. Choice C is incorrect. Although the speaker describes seeing a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed nger, she wonders about that natural image (asking why the nger, which is really a tree, is black and why it’s pointing) and doesn’t give any indication that any people are present in the scene. Choice D is incorrect. Although the speaker examines and wonders about one thing in her surroundings—a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed nger—she doesn’t address her own emotional state or consider how it’s affected by her surroundings.",

    optionA: "A. deceptive",
    optionB: "B. innocuous",
    optionC: "C. novel",
    optionD: "D. impractical",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ward and colleagues’ ndings. As used in this context, “innocuous” means mild or unharmful. The text describes the vibration and warming that Ward and colleagues used to alleviate itching as “harmless applications” and goes on to contrast these applications with another stimulus that actually offers more relief even though it seems to be stronger and “less benign.” This context conveys the idea that vibration and warming were innocuous stimuli. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a distinction between harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign. Nothing in the text suggests that any of the treatments are “deceptive,” or misleading; indeed, even the less effective ones are described as offering some relief. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on the amount of relief from itching offered by harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign. The text doesn’t suggest that any of these stimuli are “novel,” or original and new; heat, vibration, and electricity aren’t new inventions. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to describe an application of vibration or warming as “impractical,” or not suitable for use.

    optionB: "B. explicable",
    optionC: "C. regrettable",
    optionD: "D. intangible",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how Nia Imara facilitates the study of star formations. As used in this context "intangible" means unable to be physically handled or touched. The text states that star formations cannot be touched, and then goes on to explain that Imara created a special model to research star formations. In other words, despite the fact that real star formations are intangible, thanks to Imara, researchers can handle models of star formations to better understand them. Choice A is incorrect because "repeatable" means can be duplicated or done again, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that the swirls of gas and dust in which stars form are untouchable, but that Nia Imara has produced interactive models of them. It would therefore be illogical to suggest that Imara believes that the formations need not be duplicated and then go on to say that she has copied them. Choice B is incorrect because "explicable" means explainable or understandable, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Nia Imara believes that star formations can be fully explained but rather that she produced interactive models to physically study them because researchers are unable to touch them directly. Choice C is incorrect because "regrettable" means distressing or unfortunate, which wouldn’t make sense in context.

    optionA: "A. impartial",
    optionB: "B. offhand",
    optionC: "C. persistent",
    optionD: "D. mandatory",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Annie Dodge Wauneka’s work as a Navajo Nation legislator. As used in this context, “persistent” means existing continuously. The text states that Wauneka “continuously worked to promote public health,” traveling extensively and authoring a medical dictionary; this indicates that Wauneka’s effort was persistent. Choice A is incorrect because describing Wauneka’s effort related to public health as “impartial,” or not partial or biased and treating all things equally, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text suggests that Wauneka’s continuous work was partial in one way, as she focused specically on promoting public health throughout the Navajo homeland and to speakers of the Navajo language. Choice B is incorrect because the text emphasizes that Wauneka’s effort to promote public health as a Navajo Nation legislator was continuous and extensive, involving wide travels and the authoring of a medical dictionary. Because this work clearly involved care and dedication, it wouldn’t make sense to describe it as “offhand,” or casual and informal. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Wauneka’s effort to promote public health was “mandatory,” or required by law or rule, even though Wauneka was a Navajo Nation legislator.

According to the second law of thermodynamics, at a macroscopic level some processes of heat transfer are irreversible due to the production of entropy—after a transfer we cannot rewind time and place molecules back exactly where they were before, just as we cannot unbreak dropped eggs. But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes should be reversible.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. Author 1 describes the puzzle that physicists still can’t solve: at a microscopic level, the “laws of physics” suggest that we should be able to reverse processes that are not reversible at a macroscopic level (and, maybe, turn back time!). The experiment conrmed that those processes are not reversible even on the microscopic level, but it didn’t explain why. This supports Author 1’s point that physicists still don’t fully understand how things work at a microscopic level—maybe the laws need to be revised. Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Text 2 does name two of the physicists involved in the experiment, but it never suggests that they disagree on anything. Choice C is incorrect. This is the opposite of what the experiment suggests. The experiment conrmed that the macroscopic-level law (“these things can’t be reversed—like time”) was still true on the microscopic level—meaning it supports the current understanding of physics at a macroscopic level. Choice D is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment.

    optionC: "C. renunciation of",
    optionD: "D. mastery over",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s description of how Pico feels about the natural world. In this context, to say that Pico portrays his “ambivalence toward” nature would mean that he portrays his mixed feelings about nature. The text explains that Pico “honors the centrality of nature” and also makes it clear that he doesn’t enjoy being in nature. This context suggests that Pico feels ambivalence toward nature. Choice A is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “responsiveness to” nature would mean that he portrays himself as quick to react to nature, which isn’t supported by the text. Instead, the text focuses on Pico’s mixed feelings toward nature, describing him as both honoring nature’s role in his tribe’s beliefs and expressing his personal dislike for being in nature. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “renunciation of” nature would mean that he portrays himself as rejecting nature, which isn’t supported by the text. The text conveys that Pico demonstrates both positive and negative responses toward nature, not that he’s giving it up completely. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “mastery over” nature would mean that he portrays himself as having control over nature, which isn’t supported by the text.

According to the text, a team of paleontologists has found fossils that are very well preserved. For this reason, the text suggests, the paleontologists have been able to gain detailed information from the fossils, such as the color patterns of the life forms that left them behind. Choice A is incorrect because "occupy" means engage or inhabit, neither of which would make sense in context. It’s unclear what it would mean for detailed information revealed by fossils to be engaged or inhabited. Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the paleontologists wanted to "hoard," or collect and hide, the detailed information revealed by the well-preserved fossils.

      "Text 1 Graphic novels are increasingly popular in bookstores and libraries, but they shouldn’t be classied as literature. By denition, literature tells a story or conveys meaning through language only; graphic novels tell stories through illustrations and use language only sparingly, in captions and dialogue. Graphic novels are experienced as series of images and not as language, making them more similar to lm than to literature. Text 2 Graphic novels present their stories through both language and images. Without captions and dialogue, readers would be unable to understand what is depicted in the illustrations: the story results from the interaction of text and image. Moreover, Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home and many other graphic novels feature text that is as beautifully written as the prose found in many standard novels. Therefore, graphic novels qualify as literary texts. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the overall argument presented in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By asserting that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes",
    optionB:
      "B. By acknowledging that the author of Text 1 has identied a aw that is common to all graphic novels",
    optionC:
      "C. By suggesting that the story lines of certain graphic novels are more dicult to understand than the author of Text 1 claims",
    optionD:
      "D. By agreeing with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren’t as well crafted as most literary works are",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the argument presented in Text 1. In arguing that graphic novels shouldn’t be classied as literature and are more comparable to lm, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used "only sparingly"—that is, comparatively very little—in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn’t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are "beautifully written" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel’s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes. Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn’t be classied as literature based on their limited use of language, there’s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a aw, just that it doesn’t t the particular denition of "literature" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common aw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are "beautifully written," and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is awed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn’t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more dicult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn’t imply that graphic novels aren’t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to t the denition of "literature," and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to lm than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written—that is, well crafted—as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn’t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted.',

    optionB: "B. inspecting",
    optionC: "C. creating",
    optionD: "D. deciding",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the work of particle physicists. In this context, “inspecting” means viewing closely in order to examine. The text indicates that as particle physicists, Arce and El-Khadra’s work involves using advanced technology to “closely examine” subatomic particles. In other words, they use technology to inspect small parts of matter that can’t be seen by the naked eye. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Arce and El-Khadra spend time “selecting,” or choosing, subatomic particles for some purpose; the text simply states that the particle physicists use advanced technology to see and study the behavior of those tiny parts of matter. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Arce and El-Khadra spend time “creating” subatomic particles, or bringing them into existence; the text simply states that the particle physicists use advanced technology to see and study the behavior of those tiny parts of matter. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “deciding” would mean making a nal choice or judgment about something. It wouldn’t make sense to say that particle physicists get to choose what is and isn’t visible to the naked eye, especially when the text presents it as fact that subatomic particles are “the smallest detectable parts of matter” and would therefore be invisible.

    optionB: "B. Disapproving of",
    optionC: "C. Asserting possession of",
    optionD: "D. Providing resistance to",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, "disputing" most nearly means providing resistance to. The narrator is in a taxi as it drives down a street lined with so many food vendors and shoppers that the narrator describes them as "the multitude of Paris," meaning an immense group of people. The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that "every inch" of the taxi’s progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi’s attempt to drive down the street. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "disputing" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn’t portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "disputing" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn’t suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi’s attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi’s progress. Choice C is incorrect because, as the narrator explains, both the multitude of people and the taxi are using a public space (a street) at the same time. The narrator doesn’t go so far as to suggest that the people feel that they, and not the taxi, possess exclusive access to the street.',

      "Text 1 What factors inuence the abundance of species in a given ecological community? Some theorists have argued that historical diversity is a major driver of how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes: differences in community diversity across otherwise similar habitats, in this view, are strongly affected by the number of species living in those habitats at earlier times. Text 2 In 2010, a group of researchers including biologist Carla Cáceres created articial pools in a New York forest. They stocked some pools with a diverse mix of zooplankton species and others with a single zooplankton species and allowed the pool communities to develop naturally thereafter. Over the course of four years, Cáceres and colleagues periodically measured the species diversity of the pools, nding—contrary to their expectations—that by the end of the study there was little to no difference in the pools’ species diversity. Based on the texts, how would Cáceres and colleagues (Text 2) most likely describe the view of the theorists presented in Text 1?",

    optionD:
      "D. It probably holds true only in conditions like those in the research team’s study.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer. This is how Cáceres and co. would most likely describe the view presented in Text 1. The view in Text 1 is that historical diversity affects how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes. But Cáceres and co. did not get this result: they found no difference in eventual diversity between a zooplankton pool that started out diverse and a zooplankton pool that started out with only a single species. Choice A is incorrect. Cáceres and co. would probably not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way. The view in Text 1 is that historical diversity affects how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes. Cáceres and co’s ndings directly undermine this view: they found no difference in eventual diversity between a zooplankton pool that started out diverse and a zooplankton pool that started out with only a single species. Choice B is incorrect. Cáceres and co. would probably not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way. Their experiment was designed to test this hypothesis, and their ndings were "contrary to their expectations." In other words, before the study, they predicted the theory was correct. Choice D is incorrect. Cáceres and co. would not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way.

    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the discovery of a carved wooden gure dating to around 2,000 years ago. In this context, “rarely” means infrequently. The text states that the discovery of the gure was “truly surprising” and notes that wooden objects are highly prone to rot. This context conveys the idea that wooden objects infrequently survive for as long as the carved gure has survived. Choice A is incorrect because “sturdily” means strongly, which wouldn’t make sense in context. If wooden objects in general could strongly survive for long periods of time, then the discovery of a wooden gure that’s around 2,000 years old wouldn’t be surprising. Choice B is incorrect because “carelessly” means accidentally. The text conveys the idea that wooden objects in general don’t survive for very long because they rot, not that wooden objects in general accidentally survive despite this. Choice D is incorrect because the text conveys the idea that wooden objects in general don’t survive for very long because they rot, not that wooden objects in general “simply,” or merely, survive for long periods of time.

      "Text 1 Mycoprotein is a fungal biomass that can be eaten as an alternative to meat. Studies of the environmental impact of its manufacture generally agree it is lower than that of beef and closer to that of chicken or pork. But the expense of producing mycoprotein restricts its availability to a few countries with postindustrial economies. Knowing that cost reductions would expand access to mycoprotein, biochemists are exploring solutions, such as a cheaper substrate to feed the mycoprotein as it grows. Text 2 Cattle farming is a principal cause of global deforestation, and a study by Florian Humpenöder and his colleagues found that replacing 20% of beef consumption worldwide with consumption of mycoprotein would cut deforestation by half if accomplished over the next thirty years. However, this would likely involve only a small change in agricultural water consumption, since water once dedicated to raising cattle would be diverted to raising crops instead. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the study ndings mentioned in Text 2?",
    optionA:
      "A. By emphasizing that since agricultural water consumption would remain static in the event of replacing beef consumption with mycoprotein consumption, an\neffort must be made to substitute mycoprotein for chicken and pork in diets as well",
    optionB:
      "B. By asserting that the development of a more inexpensive substrate for mycoprotein production would contribute to the goal of decreasing worldwide\ndeforestation over time",
    optionC:
      "C. By noting that most people would be more likely to use mycoprotein as a substitute for chicken or pork in their diets than as a substitute for beef",
    optionD:
      "D. By pointing out that some countries are responsible for greater deforestation than others and thus, to have any signicant effect on the environment, will have\nto replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to the study ndings described in Text 2. The author of Text 2 discusses a study by Florian Humpenöder and his colleagues that found that deforestation would be reduced by half over the next thirty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide were replaced with mycoprotein. The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study ndings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people’s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people’s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally benecial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specic issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue. Choice C is incorrect. Although Text 1 does compare the environmental effects of producing mycoprotein to those of producing chicken or pork, nothing in Text 1 suggests that the author believes that people are more likely to replace chicken or pork with mycoprotein than they are to replace beef with mycoprotein. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 makes no mention of countries’ varying contributions to deforestation, so there is no evidence that the author of Text 1 would respond to the nding described in Text 2 by saying that some countries will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein.",

    optionA: "A. delegate",
    optionB: "B. compose",
    optionC: "C. interpret",
    optionD: "D. renounce",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of John Ashbery’s poems. As used in this context, “interpret” would mean decipher the meaning of. The text indicates that Ashbery’s poems have many unusual features, that it’s dicult to tell what exactly the poems’ subject matter is, and that scholars strongly disagree about the poems. This context conveys the idea that it’s dicult to interpret Ashbery’s poems. Choice A is incorrect because “delegate” means to assign someone as a representative of another person or to entrust something to someone else, neither of which would make sense in context. The text is focused only on the diculty that readers have interpreting Ashbery’s poems due to their many unusual features; it doesn’t suggest anything about the poems being dicult to delegate.

Lily had no real intimacy with nature, but she had a passion for the appropriate and could be keenly sensitive to a scene which was the tting background of her own sensations. The landscape outspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and she found something of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its long free reaches. On the nearer slopes the sugar-maples wavered like pyres of light; lower down was a massing of grey orchards, and here and there the lingering green of an oak-grove. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?",

    optionD:
      "D. It illustrates an idea that is introduced in the previous sentence.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence of the text establishes that Lily can be “keenly sensitive to” scenes that serve as a “tting background” for her feelings—that is, she’s very aware of when a setting seems to reect her mood. The next sentence, which is underlined, then demonstrates this awareness: Lily views the landscape she’s in as a large-scale reection of her current mood, identifying with elements such as its calmness. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to illustrate an idea introduced in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes the scene only in very general terms, referring to its calmness, breadth, and long stretches of land. It’s the next sentence that adds specic details about colors, light, and various trees nearby. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence suggests that Lily is experiencing an internal conict. In fact, the sentence indicates that Lily thinks the landscape reects her own feeling of calmness. Choice C is incorrect because the only assertion in the underlined sentence is that Lily feels that broad aspects of the landscape, such as its calmness, reect her current mood, and that assertion isn’t expanded on in the next sentence.

    question:
      "Text 1 Flamingos are known for their vibrant pink coloring, but they’re actually born with gray feathers. Their pink color comes from eating brine shrimp, but brine shrimp aren’t naturally pink either. Animals can’t produce carotenoids, the pigments that provide the pink hue. The algae that brine shrimp feed on, however, can produce these pigments. Thus, the pinker the amingo, the more shrimp it has eaten. Text 2 Ecologist Juan Amat has found that amingos apply a kind of makeup to make themselves appear pinker. A gland near their tail contains pigments that come from the food they eat. When the amingos groom themselves using the pigments, their feathers become pinker. Flamingos may do this to improve their success during mating season, when they would benet from looking pinker. Based on the texts, how would the ecologist in Text 2 most likely respond to the author’s conclusion in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By emphasizing that amingos’ tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers are",
    optionB:
      "B. By claiming that the coloring of amingos’ feathers doesn’t change signicantly enough for most observers to notice",
    optionC:
      "C. By pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn’t the only thing that inuences amingos’ coloring",
    optionD:
      "D. By arguing that amingos’ diet doesn’t include much shrimp except during mating season",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it describes how the ecologist in Text 2 would most likely respond to the author’s conclusion in Text 1 based on the information provided. The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of amingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp amingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a amingo that is pinker than another amingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that amingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a amingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the amingo’s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker amingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn’t the only thing that inuences amingos’ coloring. Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that amingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn’t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a amingo’s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that amingos’ feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn’t notice a change wouldn’t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a amingo’s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about amingos’ shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that amingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn’t discuss the diet of amingos at all.",

    question:
      "Some bird species don’t raise their own chicks. Instead, adult females lay their eggs in other nests, next to another bird species’ own eggs. Female cuckoos have been seen quickly laying eggs in the nests of other bird species when those birds are out looking for food. After the eggs hatch, the noncuckoo parents will typically raise the cuckoo chicks as if they were their own offspring, even if the cuckoos look very different from the other chicks. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?",
    optionA:
      "A. It introduces a physical feature of female cuckoos that is described later in the text.",
    optionB:
      "B. It describes the appearance of the cuckoo nests mentioned earlier in the text.",
    optionC:
      "C. It offers a detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior discussed in the text.",
    optionD:
      "D. It explains how other birds react to the female cuckoo behavior discussed in the text.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst two sentences establish that birds of some species don’t raise their own young; instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of birds of other species. The underlined sentence then states that female cuckoo birds engage in this behavior, having been observed specically laying their eggs in other nests while the other birds are out nding food. According to the text, the cuckoo chicks are then raised by the other birds. Thus, the underlined sentence provides a particular detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior of laying eggs for other birds to raise. Choice A is incorrect. Rather than mentioning a physical feature of female cuckoos, the underlined sentence introduces a specic behavior of female cuckoos: laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away. The only reference to physical features is the last sentence’s general mention of cuckoo chicks looking different from chicks of other species. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and doesn’t describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise. Instead, the sentence addresses how female cuckoos use other birds’ nests. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes only female cuckoo behavior (laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away); it’s the last sentence of the text that addresses the other birds’ reaction, indicating that those birds usually raise the cuckoo chicks once they’ve hatched.",

      "Changes to vegetation cover and other human activities inuence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, though how deep these effects extend is unclear. Hypothesizing that differences in land use lead to differences in carbon and nitrogen levels that are not restricted to the topsoil layer (0–30 cm deep), Chukwuebuka Okolo and colleagues sampled soils across multiple land-use types (e.g., grazing land, cropland, forest) within each of several Ethiopian locations. They found, though, that across land-use types, carbon and nitrogen decreased to comparably low levels beyond depths of 30 cm. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. It describes a phenomenon that scientists do not fully understand, explains a research team’s hypothesis about that phenomenon, and then describes a nding\nthat led the team to rene the hypothesis.",
    optionB:

    optionC:
      "C. It discusses a process that scientists are somewhat unclear about, introduces competing hypotheses about that process, and then explains how a research\nteam concluded that one of those hypotheses is likely correct.",
    optionD:
      "D. It explains a hypothesis that has been the subject of scientic debate, discusses how a research team tested that hypothesis, and then presents data the team\ncollected that validate the hypothesis.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by explaining that human activities inuence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues’ hypothesis regarding this question—which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer—and then briey explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a nding that conicts with the team’s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientic question, presents a research team’s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conicted with their hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities inuence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn’t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team’s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn’t describe how the team rened their hypothesis when a research nding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientic question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn’t mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo’s team was able to determine which hypothesis was correct. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientic debate; rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by Okolo and colleagues. While the text does explain how Okolo’s team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on to say that their data conicted with their hypothesis, not that the data validated, or supported, their hypothesis.",

      "While scholars believe many Mesoamerican cities inuenced each other, direct evidence of such inuence is dicult to ascertain. However, recent excavations in a sector of Tikal (Guatemala) unearthed a citadel that shows ______ Teotihuacán (Mexico) architecture—including a near replica of a famed Teotihuacán temple— providing tangible evidence of outside inuence in portions of Tikal. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. renements of",
    optionB: "B. precursors of",
    optionC: "C. commonalities with",
    optionD: "D. animosities toward",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of architectural inuences among Mesoamerican cities. In this context, “commonalities with” means similarities to or shared attributes with. The text indicates that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in Teotihuacán (another Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuacán inuence, which suggests that the citadel possesses features that resemble architectural features found in Teotihuacán. This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuacán architecture. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows “renements of,” or improvements on, Teotihuacán architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuacán inuenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it’s possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn’t discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuacán architecture, the Tikal citadel’s builders improved on it. Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing “precursors of” Teotihuacán architecture—or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuacán architecture—would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuacán. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuacán, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuacán, provides evidence of outside inuences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was inuenced by Teotihuacán architecture, then the Teotihuacán architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn’t make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuacán architecture. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the inuence of Teotihuacán architecture, which implies that the makers of the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuacán architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there’s no reason to think that the Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people’s “animosities toward,” or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward, Teotihuacán architecture.",

From the sterile soil no ray Of hope in a blade of green, Nor sheltering roof is seen— Though the skies are heavy and gray. Ah, this is the woman fair Who stole away my heart In the splendid halls of art Yester-e’en as I wandered there! As used in the text, what does the word “sheltering” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Protective",
    optionB: "B. Restrictive",
    optionC: "C. Affectionate",
    optionD: "D. Suspicious",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "sheltering" most nearly means protective. In the text, the speaker describes a painting featuring a female gure. The speaker ultimately confesses to falling in love with the woman in the painting, who has "stole[n] away" the speaker’s heart, but rst the speaker describes elements of the painting’s setting. These include sterile soil, barren elds with "no ray / Of hope in a blade of green"—a description that conveys a mood of melancholy and forlornness, possibly reecting the speaker’s own sadness at falling in love with an image that can’t return the speaker’s love. The text continues by stating that there’s no "sheltering roof" in the painting, even though the "skies are heavy and gray," showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof’s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive—that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldn’t limit the wind and rain, only deect them. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that if a "sheltering roof" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word "sheltering" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that if any roofs were present in the painting, they would be questionable or cause any suspicion.',

Mrs. Spring Fragrance was unaware that Mr. Spring Fragrance, tired with the day’s business, had thrown himself down on the bamboo settee on the veranda, and that although his eyes were engaged in scanning the pages of the Chinese World, his ears could not help receiving the words which were borne to him through the open window. As used in the text, what does the word “receiving” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Denying",
    optionB: "B. Entering",
    optionC: "C. Carrying",
    optionD: "D. Hearing",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “receiving” most nearly means hearing, or perceiving sound. The text describes Mr. Spring Fragrance as he reads a newspaper, focusing on his eyes and ears. While his eyes look at the newspaper, he is unwillingly distracted by words coming through a nearby open window (that is, “his ears could not help receiving the words”). The words are being perceived specically by his ears and not his eyes, and ears are the organs of sense with which one hears, so therefore Mr. Spring Fragrance is hearing the words through the open window. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that Mr. Spring Fragrance is denying, or refusing the truth of, the words coming to him through the window. He is merely distracted by them. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that Mr. Spring Fragrance’s ears couldn’t help entering, or coming into, the words coming to him through the window. Instead, the text indicates that the opposite occurs: that is, when Mr. Spring Fragrance hears the words, they enter his ears, but his ears don’t enter the words. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn’t make sense in this context to think of Mr. Spring Fragrance as carrying the words coming to him through the window, even though the word “carry” can have a number of different meanings depending on context: for example, he is not lifting them, he is not supporting them, and he is not accepting blame for them (as one “carries the blame” for a mistake).",

    optionC: "C. exaggerate",
    optionD: "D. preserve",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of climate activity in Earth’s distant past. In this context, to “simulate” most nearly means to represent a natural process using computer models. According to the text, understanding Earth’s early climate is dicult because we cannot make direct observations of the distant past. Instead, scientists must create computer models that approximate early climate conditions, based on the physical evidence that those conditions left behind on Earth’s surface. This context supports the idea that computer models simulate Earth’s climate in the distant past. Choice A is incorrect because scientists use existing physical evidence as a basis for developing computer models that describe what Earth’s actual past climate might have been like. The models are not being used to “invent,” or imagine, a completely ctional climate. Choice C is incorrect because the computer models are being used in an attempt to describe as accurately as possible what Earth’s past climate might have been like.

    optionD:
      "D. It establishes that criticism of the CEP was limited to a few individuals in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence of the text states that the CEP had a positive impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. The next sentence explains that the CEP organized workshops for attendees, who later used the knowledge they gained to lead civil rights initiatives. And the underlined portion indicates the number of activists—more than 7,000—who participated in the workshops. Thus, the underlined portion provides a number that underscores the extent of the CEP’s impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Choice B is incorrect.

After further research, Sharif concluded that this dip in life satisfaction mainly occurred when individuals spent all their free time unproductively, such as by watching TV or playing games. Text 2 Psychologist James Maddux cautions against suggesting an ideal amount of free time. The human desire for both free time and productivity is universal, but Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction. Furthermore, he points out that there is no objective denition for what constitutes productivity; reading a book might be considered a productive activity by some, but idleness by others. Based on the texts, how would Maddux (Text 2) most likely respond to the conclusion Sharif (Text 1) reached after her further research?",

    optionD:
      "D. By claiming that the specic activities named in Text 1 are actually examples of productive activities rather than unproductive ones",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it characterizes how Maddux would most likely respond to the conclusion Sharif reached after her research. Text 1 describes Sharif’s study of the benets of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at ve hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she denes as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective denition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. Choice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after ve hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively—that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively. Choice D is incorrect because Maddux holds the opinion that whether an activity is productive or unproductive is subjective and depends on the individual; therefore, he would most likely claim that watching TV or playing games might be productive for some and unproductive for others.",

The company further solidied its ______ in rail access to the state’s Pacic coast when it completed the Sunset Route in 1883: running from Louisiana to Southern California, the route established the rst transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. dominance",
    optionB: "B. creativity",
    optionC: "C. insignicance",
    optionD: "D. neutrality",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of the Southern Pacic Railroad. As used in this context, "dominance" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacic Railroad already controlled 85% of California’s railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the rst transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacic Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California’s coast. Choice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word "creativity" would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Pacic Railroad already controlled 85% of California’s railways. The text is more focused on the railroad’s control of the eld and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Pacic Railroad controlled the majority of California’s railways, it would not make sense to refer to its "insignicance," or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Pacic Railroad’s "neutrality," or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned. Nor would "neutrality" in the sense of impartiality in a conict be a logical or precise choice since no conict is explicitly described. There might be an implied conict between the Southern Pacic Railroad and other railroads doing business in California, but that is not a conict in which the Southern Pacic Railroad would take an impartial position.',

    question:
      "Mathematician Claude Shannon is widely regarded as a foundational gure in information theory. His most important paper, “A Mathematical Theory of Communication,” published in 1948 when he was employed at Bell Labs, utilized a concept called a “binary digit” (shortened to “bit”) to measure the amount of information in any signal and determine the fastest rate at which information could be transmitted while still being reliably decipherable. Robert Gallagher, one of Shannon’s colleagues, said that the bit was “[Shannon’s] discovery, and from it the whole communications revolution has sprung.” Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. It presents a theoretical concept, illustrates how the name of the concept has changed, and shows how the name has entered common usage.",

    question:
      "Text 1 Today the starchy root cassava is found in many dishes across West Africa, but its rise to popularity was slow. Portuguese traders brought cassava from Brazil to the West African coast in the 1500s. But at this time, people living in the capitals further inland had little contact with coastal communities. Thus, cassava remained relatively unknown to most of the region’s inhabitants until the 1800s. Text 2 Cassava’s slow adoption into the diet of West Africans is mainly due to the nature of the crop itself. If not cooked properly, cassava can be toxic. Knowledge of how to properly prepare cassava needed to spread before the food could grow in popularity. The arrival of formerly enslaved people from Brazil in the 1800s, who brought their knowledge of cassava and its preparation with them, thus directly fueled the spread of this crop. Based on the texts, the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?",

    optionD:
      "D. To describe certain limitations to conducting scientic study in the Atacama Desert",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence describes a unique location on Earth, the Atacama Desert. The next sentence, which is the underlined sentence, states that the reason why astrobiologists study life, or its remains, in this unique location is that Atacama is a harsh environment that closely resembles the extreme environment of Mars. The remainder of the text explains that the researchers hope their work in Atacama will support inquiry into life on Mars. Thus, the underlined portion functions mainly to indicate why astrobiologists choose to conduct research in the Atacama Desert. Choice A is incorrect because to contrast two things means to show the differences between them, and the phrase "closely mirrors" in the underlined sentence indicates that the extreme environment in the Atacama Desert is similar to, not different from, that on Mars. This similarity is why, according to the underlined sentence, astrobiologists conduct research in Atacama. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t address forms of life that are unable to survive the harsh environment of the Atacama Desert. Instead, the underlined sentence explains why astrobiologists study life, or its remains, in this environment. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t suggest that the scientic research in the Atacama Desert is limited in any way; instead, the sentence explains that the similarity between the environments of Atacama and Mars is the reason why astrobiologists search for life, or its remains, in Atacama.',

More and more often he was asked to compromise his art or himself in one way or another, and more often than not he did so, for he was inclined to be passive and naïve; it was dicult for him to say no. Those who exhibited his work, who praised and purchased it, and who demanded its proliferation began to determine it. ©1989 by N. Scott Momaday As used in the text, what does the word “determine” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Conclude",
    optionB: "B. Dictate",
    optionC: "C. Evaluate",
    optionD: "D. Select",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text "determine" most nearly means "dictate." The text describes the relationship between the main character and those who exhibit, praise, and purchase his artwork. The text states that the main character is often asked to change his art or himself based on outside inuences, and he usually acquiesces. Because the main character admits that those who support his work often shape it based on their demands, it follows that those outside inuences dictate, or guide or dominate, the direction his work takes. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that outside inuences "conclude," or end, the main character’s work. The text states that many supporters of the main character’s art "demand its proliferation," not its conclusion. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that outside inuences are "evaluating," or judging the main character’s work. According to the text, the main character’s art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, and praising his work. Thus, outsiders have already supported the main character’s work and are not questioning or evaluating its success or worth. They are instead inuencing its initial direction. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that outside inuences "select," or choose the main character’s work. According to the text, the main character’s art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, and praising his work.

    optionB: "B. an acceptable",
    optionC: "C. an imperceptible",
    optionD: "D. a substantial",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the research that Lopes-Ferreira and her colleagues are conducting on the stingray species Potamotrygon rex. As used in this context, “a substantial” effect means an effect that is sizable or noteworthy. The text indicates that the researchers are seeking to determine whether there are “considerable variations” in the potency of stingray venom that are associated with variation in the stingrays’ age and sex. This context suggests that the researchers want to nd out whether stingray age and sex have a substantial effect on venom toxicity. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the researchers have been studying whether the stingrays’ age and sex have “a disconcerting,” or an unsettling and disturbing, effect on the stingrays’ venom. The text indicates that the researchers wish to determine if stingray age and sex cause large variations in the toxicity of stingray venom, not if the effect of age and sex is disconcerting. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that researchers want to nd out whether differences in stingray age and sex produce differences in stingray venom, not that the researchers want to nd out whether age and sex have “an acceptable,” or a satisfactory, effect on venom. The text makes no mention of what would make an effect on venom toxicity acceptable and gives no indication that the researchers are interested in that question. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for the researchers to be looking for “an imperceptible,” or an unnoticeable, effect of age and sex on stingray venom.

    optionB: "B. ignore",
    optionC: "C. promote",
    optionD: "D. reduce",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the preservation efforts undertaken by Erika Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana. In this context, "promote" means play a part in the success or growth of something or someone. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes work to preserve culturally important sites. It goes on to say that their decision to create a national trail connecting the sites was motivated by the fact that such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn’t otherwise receive. Thus, such a decision would promote the preservation efforts. Choice A is incorrect because "inspire" means motivate or inuence, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text establishes that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally signicant sites and that their decision to create a new national trail occurred as a result of a desire to add protections to the sites that they wouldn’t otherwise receive. Thus, creating the trail wouldn’t inspire the efforts to preserve the sites; instead, it would promote the efforts. Choice B is incorrect because "ignore" means overlook, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally signicant sites and that they decided to create a national trail connecting the sites because such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn’t otherwise receive. Thus, the creation of the trail would promote, not ignore, the preservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect because "reduce" means decrease or restrict, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally signicant sites and that they decided to create a national trail connecting the sites because such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn’t otherwise receive.

Using data spanning from 1994 to 2010 for a set of US companies, the team compared over 29,000 annual earnings forecasts to the actual earnings later reported by those companies. The team found that the greater the exposure to sunshine at work in the two weeks before a manager submitted an earnings forecast, the more the manager’s forecast exceeded what the company actually earned that year.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence presents the implications of Veeraraghavan’s team’s study: sunshine exposure during work hours can cause overly optimistic behavior. The underlined sentence then describes the data the team consulted and how they were used (comparing predictions about earnings to what the companies actually earned), and the nal sentence presents what the team found in their examination of the data. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to explain part of the methodology used in the team’s study. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence explains in part how the team conducted their analysis of the effect of sunshine but doesn’t address what the team found; a broad summary is instead given in the other two sentences. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t present any specic examples from the team’s comparisons of 29,000 earnings predictions to actual earnings; it simply explains in part how the team conducted their analysis.

Text 2 states that the researchers used cosmogenic nuclide dating to "avoid the potential for misdating" caused by the geology of Sterkfontein, which Text 1 describes as "challenging" and unreliable. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text suggests that the A. africanus fossils have been "corrupted," but only that traditional dating methods are dicult in Sterkfontein because of oods and soil mixing where the fossils were found. Nothing is implied to have compromised the fossils themselves. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 2.

    optionC: "C. comforting",
    optionD: "D. ensuring",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of cucurbits. In this context, “ensuring” means guaranteeing, or making sure of, the cucurbits’ survival. The text states that cucurbits faced extinction in the past because their means of seed dispersal disappeared, but the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America began farming cucurbits around that same time, so the crops were no longer threatened. Therefore, the context supports the idea that the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America helped with ensuring the cucurbits’ survival. Choice A is incorrect because in this context verifying means making sure that something is accurate. In the text, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America were ensuring the survival, not the accuracy of, the cucurbits. Choice B is incorrect. Although the cucurbit crops themselves were multiplying, or growing in number, as a result of the work of the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America, it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that the survival of the plants was multiplying.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. The text after the semicolon tells us that Hu "identif[ied] broad similarities between two seemingly different phenomena," comparing ants with light particles. Since an analogy seeks similarities between seemingly unrelated phenomena, this ts the context perfectly. Choice A is incorrect.

What a photograph conveys is therefore largely ______ how it is balanced. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. inhibited by",
    optionB: "B. contingent on",
    optionC: "C. obligated to",
    optionD: "D. reserved for",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of visual balance in photography. In this context, "contingent on" means conditional upon, or determined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends to emphasize similarity among elements, whereas asymmetry tends to emphasize difference). Thus, there is a strong connection between what a photograph conveys and how its elements are balanced. Therefore, what a photo conveys is contingent on how it is balanced. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "inhibited by" most nearly means hindered or undermined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers, thereby indicating a relationship between image balance and what is conveyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a photographer choosing asymmetrical balance even while intending to convey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), there is nothing to indicate that messages generally are inhibited by balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a tool photographers can use to craft their messages. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "obligated to" means duty bound toward or answerable to. In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph’s message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, "reserved for" most nearly means solely available to someone or held aside for some purpose.

The text implies, however, that recent scholarship has shown that his works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time. This context supports the idea that his works weren’t inconsequential to Islamic thought in this period. Choice A is incorrect because the issue under consideration in the text is whether other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd’s time had access to his works, not whether his works were "controversial among," or causing dispute among, other philosophers. Choice B is incorrect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd’s era were aware of his works, not that they were "antagonistic toward," or hostile toward, them. There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd’s writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "imitated by" would mean followed as a model by. Although the text implies that Ibn Rushd’s works were at least somewhat available in regions that were at the center of Islamic thought during the period, it doesn’t specically address in what ways his works inuenced contemporary Muslim philosophers. Thus, the text doesn’t support the idea that other philosophers modeled their own works after Ibn Rushd’s works.',

    question:
      "Whether the reign of a French monarch such as Hugh Capet or Henry I was historically consequential or relatively uneventful, its trajectory was shaped by questions of legitimacy and therefore cannot be understood without a corollary understanding of the factors that allowed the monarch to ______ his right to hold the throne. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. disengage",
    optionB: "B. annotate",
    optionC: "C. buttress",
    optionD: "D. reciprocate",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the legitimacy of the reigns of French monarchs such as Hugh Capet and Henry I. As used in this context, “buttress” means to strengthen or defend. The text indicates that regardless of whether a French monarch’s reign was signicant or uneventful, each monarch faced questions about his right to the throne. The text goes on to say that in order to understand the path of a French monarch’s reign, it’s important to understand what contributed to the monarch’s ability to “hold the throne.” This context suggests that French monarchs such as Hugh Capet and Henry I had to buttress, or defend, their right to be monarch. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “disengage,” or withdraw his right to the French throne. The text focuses on an examination of people who reigned as French monarchs, not on people who didn’t choose to rule. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “annotate,” or add notes to or explain, his right to the French throne. Nothing in the text suggests that the monarchs were writing notes about their right to the throne; instead, faced with questions about the legitimacy of their reign, the monarchs defended their right. Choice D is incorrect. Saying that a monarch who is faced with questions about the legitimacy of his reign was able to “reciprocate” his right to the French throne would mean that he either returned his right to the throne or that he responded in kind to the challenge. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text focuses on people who did reign as French monarchs and defended their right to do so.",

    question:
      "According to statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the best way to predict the amount of time a nonperishable entity (such as a building or a technology) will continue to exist is to examine how long it has survived so far. In this view, an item’s age is the strongest ______ how much longer it will last. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. uncertainty about",
    optionB: "B. indicator of",
    optionC: "C. motivation for",
    optionD: "D. criticism of",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. “Indicator” means “something that shows or suggests,” which matches Taleb’s argument that an item’s age can suggest how much longer it will last. Choice A is incorrect. The passage tells us that examining an item’s age is the best way to predict how much longer it will last. Therefore, according to Taleb’s theory, an item’s age should add more certainty about how much longer it will last. Choice C is incorrect. A “motivation” is “a reason for doing.” Items don’t have feelings and motivations, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that their age is a motivation for how much longer they will last. Choice D is incorrect. “Criticism” can mean “describing faults or problems” or “an analysis of an artistic work.” Neither of these denitions makes sense here. An item’s age can’t criticize how much longer it will last.",

      "Text 1 Films and television shows commonly include a long list of credits naming the people involved in a production. Credit sequences may not be exciting, but they generally ensure that everyone’s contributions are duly acknowledged. Because they are highly standardized, lm and television credits are also valuable to anyone researching the careers of pioneering cast and crew members who have worked in the mediums. Text 2 Video game scholars face a major challenge in the industry’s failure to consistently credit the artists, designers, and other contributors involved in making video games. Without a reliable record of which people worked on which games, questions about the medium’s development can be dicult to answer, and the accomplishments of all but its best-known innovators can be dicult to trace. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the discussion in Text 2?",
    optionA:
      "A. By recommending that the scholars mentioned in Text 2 consider employing the methods regularly used by lm and television researchers",
    optionB:
      "B. By pointing out that credits have a different intended purpose in lm and television than in the medium addressed by the scholars mentioned in Text 2",
    optionC:
      "C. By suggesting that the scholars mentioned in Text 2 rely more heavily on credits as a source of information than lm and television researchers do",
    optionD:
      "D. By observing that a widespread practice in lm and television largely prevents the kind of problem faced by the scholars mentioned in Text 2",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to Text 2 based on the information provided. Text 2 discusses how the inconsistent use of credits to identify the contributors to video games can pose an obstacle to scholars of the medium, who rely on such credits to answer questions about the medium’s development. Text 1 notes that in lm and television, on the other hand, credits are used consistently and are valuable to researchers studying the cast and crew members in these mediums. Since Text 1 asserts how the consistent use of credits benets scholars of lm and television, it can be inferred that this text’s author would respond to the discussion in Text 2 by observing that the kind of problem faced by scholars of video games—the inability to know who contributed to a particular production and how—is, in lm and television studies, largely prevented by the widespread practice of credits in these mediums. Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 1 discusses a method used by lm and television researchers—namely, relying on credits to research the careers of cast and crew members—the author doesn’t explicitly recommend that or any other method. Moreover, Text 1 states that lms and television shows themselves, not their researchers, regularly use the method of listing credits. Choice B is incorrect. It can be inferred from Text 2 that when video games do feature credits, they have essentially the same function as credits in lm and television—namely, to identify the individuals who worked on a particular production. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would characterize video game credits as differing in purpose from lm and television credits. Choice C is incorrect because, as Text 2 explains, credits are not consistently used in video games. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would argue that scholars of the medium discussed in this text—video games—rely more heavily on credits than scholars of lm and television, two mediums where credits consistently appear.",

      "Economist Jingting Fan argues that the effects of international trade may display spatial variation at sub-national levels. For instance, imported goods may reduce expenses for a country’s average consumer, but for consumers living far from ports, high intranational transport costs could ______ the price advantages associated with imports. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. nullify",
    optionB: "B. denigrate",
    optionC: "C. underestimate",
    optionD: "D. misconstrue",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion of imported goods and consumer prices. In this context, "nullify" most nearly means negate or undermine. The text indicates that importing goods to a country can reduce consumer prices in that country, then cautions that the costs of transporting goods within the country is also a factor. These transportation costs likely raise the prices that must be paid by people who live far from the ports of entry. Therefore, the intranational transportation costs could nullify the price advantages to consumers of importing goods. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, "denigrate" would most nearly mean disparage or deny the importance of. Since transportation costs would not be capable of denying the importance of price advantages, it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs denigrate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "underestimate" would most nearly mean predict a lower value for, or to undervalue, someone or something. Though transportation costs might be undervalued, they cannot themselves undervalue something else, so it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs underestimate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, "misconstrue" would most nearly mean misunderstand. Since transport costs are not capable of understanding, it would not make sense to claim that intranational transportation costs misconstrue the price advantages of importing goods.',

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. complimented by",
    optionB: "B. uncertain about",
    optionC: "C. unbothered by",
    optionD: "D. inspired by",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Carmen Lomas Garza’s artistic process. In this context, "inspired by" means inuenced by or motivated by. The text refers to how, regardless of the scale of the work, Garza uses her memories of Texas and details from California to create her art. If Garza is basing her work on her direct experiences, then they play a part in her artistic process. This context thus suggests that Garza’s art is inspired by the experiences of her childhood in Texas and her current life in California. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make logical sense to indicate that Garza is "complimented by"—or praised by—something inanimate such as direct experience. Choice B is incorrect because describing Garza as "uncertain about"—or unsure or doubtful of—direct experience would suggest that she had misgivings about it. If Garza were unsure of her experiences, that would suggest that she couldn’t recall them, and Garza wouldn’t be able to represent direct experience in her art if she were uncertain of the memories or details. Choice C is incorrect because describing Garza as "unbothered by"—or uninterested in—her experience would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about Garza’s artistic process.

With so many consumer options, organizers are nding ways to cement festival attendance as a special experience worth sharing. This phenomenon is linked to the growing “experiential economy,” where many nd it gratifying to purchase lived experiences. To ensure a protable event, venues need to consider the overall consumer experience, not just the band lineup. Text 2 Music festival appearances are becoming a more important part of musicians’ careers. One factor in this shift is the rising use of streaming services that allow access to huge numbers of songs for a monthly fee, subsequently reducing sales of full-length albums. With this shift in consumer behavior, musicians are increasingly dependent on revenue from live performances. Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",

    optionB:
      "B. Consumers’ growing interest in purchasing experiences is mostly conned to the music industry.",

    optionD:
      "D. The rising consumer demand for live music festivals also generates higher demand for music streaming platforms.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer. Both authors mention how consumer behaviors have shifted, and how this affects different aspects of the music industry. Text 1 states that consumers enjoy purchasing “lived experiences,” and that this inuences how organizers design music festivals. Text 2 states that consumers are using streaming services more, and that this reduces album sales and increases the importance of live performances for musicians. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text claims that consumers prefer streaming to festivals, or that these are mutually exclusive options. Text 1 implies that festivals are popular and protable, and Text 2 never suggests that streaming services diminish the demand for live music. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 1, which identies music festivals as just one example of a broader trend of purchasing “lived experiences.” Text 2 doesn’t mention growing interest in purchasing experiences, in the music industry or otherwise. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text establishes a cause/effect relationship between the demand for festivals and the demand for streaming platforms.

    optionC: "C. opposed",
    optionD: "D. disregarded",
    correctAnswer: 0,

Because the newspapers discussed the benets of westward migration and "inspired readers to relocate," we can infer that they encouraged people to move west. Choice B is incorrect. "Assigned" means "gave a job or duty." Newspapers do not have the power to assign people to move west, although they can encourage it. Choice C is incorrect. "Opposed" means "disapproved of." We can tell that this isn’t the case, because the newspapers discussed "the easy fortunes and high salaries miners could make in California" and "inspired readers to relocate." Choice D is incorrect.

    optionC: "C. improvise",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of self-government among the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. In this context, “implement” means to carry out or put into effect. The text states that the National Council generates laws, while the principal chief and cabinet ocials are responsible for “devising policies and administering services in accordance with” those laws. This context suggests that the principal chief and cabinet ocials implement the laws: they put the laws into effect by creating policies and administering services that accord with those laws. Choice B is incorrect because “presume” in this context would mean to assume based on incomplete information, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet ocials either made assumptions about the content of the laws or had incomplete information about them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “improvise” would mean to create something without preparation, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet ocials create policies and administer services without advance preparation. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the principal chief and cabinet ocials “mimic,” or imitate, the laws generated by the National Council. To mimic laws would mean to generate new laws that are imitations of existing laws, but the text indicates that the National Council, not the principal chief and cabinet ocials, is responsible for generating laws.

    optionC: "C. Create",
    optionD: "D. Discover",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, "invent" most nearly means create or make up. The text begins by stating that Sara likes to tell stories and thoroughly enjoys telling them. The rest of the text describes how she looks and acts when she invents, or creates, "wonderful things" in her stories ("what she told"). Choice A is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Sara makes up "wonderful things," nothing suggests that she does so to mislead, or intentionally deceive, others; there is no reason to assume that Sara’s listeners don’t know that she’s creating the stories she shares. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Sara is disguising, or trying to cover up or conceal, "wonderful things" when she tells stories; rather, she is creating them and presenting them in ways that make them "lovely or alarming" for her listeners.

    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of delivering biomolecules to plant cells. In this context, “overcome” means to succeed in dealing with an obstacle. The text suggests that although it’s dicult to move biomolecules through plant cell walls, Landry and her colleagues have shown that carbon nanotubes may be useful, since they can cross cell walls. This context conveys that Landry and her colleagues think it’s possible, using carbon nanotubes, to succeed in dealing with the obstacle of transmitting biomolecules to plant cells. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to “conceptualize,” or form an idea of, the diculty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells. The text presents this diculty as a known problem that Landry and her colleagues think they may have solved, not as a mysterious occurrence that they have yet to form ideas about. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to successfully deal with the problem of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells, not that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to “neglect,” or simply to disregard and ignore the problem.

      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about the relationship between ne art and fashion. As used in this context, “intersect” means to connect or overlap. The text indicates that Jamie Okuma challenges the position held by critics because her work can be seen at an art museum and can be bought by the public from her online boutique. The text also presents the critics’ view as being inuenced by a perception that ne artists create works that are “timeless” and meant for exhibition, whereas fashion designers periodically produce new styles that are meant for purchase. This context suggests that the critics believe that ne art and fashion tend not to overlap—in other words, that they rarely intersect.

      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of manul cats. The text states that manul cats live in "out-of-the-way parts of Asia" (citing the famously remote Mount Everest as an example) and indicates that it is dicult to research the cats because of the location of their habitats. By emphasizing that the habitats are remote in relation to humans, the text conveys that being "distant from," or far from, large groups of humans makes manul cats challenging to study. Choice A is incorrect because saying that the habitats of manul cats are "full of large populations of humans" would indicate that the cats cohabitate with many humans, which would directly contradict the text’s claim that the cats live in "out-of-the-way" areas.

The passage describes two kinds of methods that can be used to "detect objects or people through walls": radar and sonar, and changes to the Wi-Fi technology used in smartphones. The word "comparatively" before the blank indicates that the best answer would be one that helps to describe a comparison between the two.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to show how Polly reacted to some of Fanny’s other friends. The text describes Polly as being frightened of Fanny’s friends because they seemed “much older and wiser” to her and elaborates that they “talked about things of which” Polly was unfamiliar, uninterested, and shocked. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to describe Polly’s impressions of Fanny’s other friends. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not provide any of the topics Polly discussed with Fanny’s friends, stating only that Polly found the topics unfamiliar, uninteresting, and shocking. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Fanny and her other friends rst met. Choice D is incorrect because the focus of the text is on Polly’s feelings about Fanny’s other friends, not on the other friends’ feelings about Polly.",

    question:
      "A number of Indigenous politicians have been elected to the United States Congress since 2000 as members of the country’s two established political parties. In Canada and several Latin American countries, on the other hand, Indigenous people have formed their own political parties to advance candidates who will advocate for the interests of their communities. This movement has been particularly successful in Ecuador, where Guadalupe Llori, a member of the Indigenous party known as Pachakutik, was elected president of the National Assembly in 2021. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To trace the history of an Indigenous political movement and speculate about its future development",
    optionB:
      "B. To argue that Indigenous politicians in the United States should form their own political party",
    optionC:
      "C. To highlight two approaches to achieving political representation for Indigenous people",
    optionD:
      "D. To consider how Indigenous politicians in the United States have inuenced Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to illustrate two approaches that Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve political representation for their communities. The text begins by explaining that one approach is exemplied by Indigenous politicians in the United States who, in an effort to ensure that the interests of their communities are represented in government, joined preexisting political parties and were subsequently elected to Congress. The text goes on to highlight a second approach adopted by Indigenous leaders in Canada and several Latin American countries: rather than joining established political parties, many Indigenous politicians in these countries have instead formed their own parties to promote candidates for oce who support causes that are important to their communities. Choice A is incorrect because the text’s focus is on the contrasting approaches adopted by different Indigenous political movements in different countries; thus, it isn’t accurate to say that the text traces the history of one political movement. Moreover, the text only discusses examples from 2000 to 2021, a relatively short period of time; therefore, it provides very little in the way of discussion of larger historical developments, nor does it make any predictions about how these movements might continue to develop in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the text never urges Indigenous politicians in the US to alter their strategy of striving for representation through the established political parties, nor does it suggest that this strategy is inferior to that of Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America, who have formed their own parties. In fact, the text notes that both strategies have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians to national governments. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that Indigenous politicians in the US have inuenced those in Canada and Latin America; instead, it stresses how Indigenous politicians’ approach toward achieving representation in the US government has differed from the approach Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve representation in national governments elsewhere in the Americas.",

    question:
      "The following text is adapted from Paul Laurence Dunbar’s 1902 novel The Sport of the Gods. Joe and some of his family members have recently moved to New York City. [Joe] was wild with enthusiasm and with a desire to be a part of all that the metropolis meant. In the evening he saw the young fellows passing by dressed in their spruce clothes, and he wondered with a sort of envy where they could be going. Back home there had been no place much worth going to, except church and one or two people’s houses. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA: "A. It illustrates a character’s reaction to a new environment.",
    optionB: "B. It explains why a character has traveled to a city.",
    optionC:
      "C. It compares a character’s thoughts about an event at two different times of day.",
    optionD: "D. It presents a character feeling regret over leaving home.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The narrator describes how Joe responds to being in “the metropolis”: he’s excited and “wild with enthusiasm.” He also envies the young fellows who walk by because, dressed as they are, they look as if they have somewhere special to go. The text contrasts this new place with the place Joe comes from, where apparently there wasn’t as much to do. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Joe’s reaction to a new environment. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to why Joe has moved. The narrator indicates that Joe is enthusiastic about being in a city, but there’s no explanation provided for the move. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no reference to how Joe thinks about an event. The narrator describes young men passing by in the evening and then recalls places worth going to at home—church and a few people’s houses—but there’s no explicit comparison made nor is a time of day mentioned for these events back home. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t support the idea that Joe feels regret over leaving home. Instead, Joe is described as “wild with enthusiasm” at being in the city. Joe’s home is mentioned, but only to compare it unfavorably with the city.",

They were twice as likely as other groups to show signs of making a permanent home. This suggests that playing recordings of a healthy ocean reef may encourage oysters to create such a reef. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. responsive",
    optionB: "B. inactive",
    optionC: "C. liked",
    optionD: "D. distressed",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of oysters and ocean recordings. As used in this context, "responsive" means reacting positively. The text presents a nding and describes it as suggesting that healthy ocean sounds may encourage oyster larvae to establish a reef (a permanent home): groups of oyster larvae that heard recorded sounds of a healthy oyster reef were two times more likely to show signs of forming their own reef than groups that heard different ocean recordings were. This context conveys that the groups that heard healthy reef sounds had a more positive reaction than the other groups did—that is, they were the most responsive. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to become "inactive," or to stop engaging in work or activity. Instead, the text conveys that the groups that heard those sounds were observed engaging in activity: they were two times more likely to create a reef (a permanent home) than groups that heard different ocean sounds were. Choice C is incorrect because describing the groups of oyster larvae that heard sounds of a healthy oyster reef as most "liked," or regarded with pleasure, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that a study found that healthy reef sounds may encourage groups of oyster larvae to form reefs (permanent homes), not on the idea that some of the groups in the study were liked more than others. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to be "distressed," or to experience diculty or begin to decline. Instead, the text indicates that the sounds increased the likelihood that groups of larvae would establish a reef (a permanent home), suggesting that the sounds had a positive effect on the larvae.',

[A] younger and less cautious man would long since have spoken. But he had made up his mind, and had only to determine the time when he would ask her to be his wife. He decided to give a ball in her honor, and at some time during the evening of the ball to offer her his heart and hand. As used in the text, what does the word “determine” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Choose",
    optionB: "B. Inuence",
    optionC: "C. Demonstrate",
    optionD: "D. Measure",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "determine" most nearly means choose or decide. The text indicates that Mr. Ryder "had made up his mind" to ask a woman to marry him but had not yet "spoken"—that is, he had not yet asked her. The text also indicates that Mr. Ryder "decided" to throw a party for the woman and ask her during it. This context conveys that after making up his mind to propose, what Mr. Ryder had to do was determine, or choose, the time to do it. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "determine" doesn’t mean inuence, or affect or control. The text isn’t indicating that Mr. Ryder is controlling time itself; such a thing isn’t possible. Rather, the text conveys that after making up his mind to ask a woman to marry him, Mr. Ryder had to make another decision about his own actions by selecting a time to propose. Choice C is incorrect. The text focuses on Mr. Ryder’s plan to ask a woman to marry him and his decision about when to ask her. This context conveys that after making up his mind to propose, Mr. Ryder had to choose the time, not that he had to demonstrate, or show, the time; it’s not clear what it would mean to demonstrate a time. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "determine" doesn’t mean measure, or control with careful restraint. The text isn’t indicating that Mr. Ryder is carefully controlling time itself; such a thing isn’t possible. Rather, the text conveys that after making up his mind to ask a woman to marry him, Mr. Ryder had to make another decision about his own actions by selecting a time to propose; it’s Mr. Ryder’s decision that is measured, not the time he eventually chooses.',

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. indifference to",
    optionB: "B. enthusiasm for",
    optionC: "C. concern about",
    optionD: "D. surprise at",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Cole’s book Blind Spot. In this context, “enthusiasm for” means excitement about. The text explains that Blind Spot consists of original photographs as well as poetic prose—two elements that correspond to Cole’s passions, identied in the text, for photography and the written word. This context suggests that Cole’s excitement about photography and writing led him to create a book that successfully combines the two mediums. Choice A is incorrect because describing Cole as feeling “indifference to” his two passions wouldn’t make sense in context. If Cole is indifferent to his passions, that would mean he doesn’t care about photography or writing—in which case they wouldn’t be his passions at all. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels “concern about,” or uneasiness about, his passions. The text’s use of the word “culminates” indicates that Blind Spot represents a triumphant climax of Cole’s passions, not a work that results from his sense of discomfort with photography and writing. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels “surprise at,” or astonished by, his passions. The text indicates that Cole’s feeling about his passions “culminates” in a book that “evocatively” combines photographs and writing, suggesting that Cole has a long-standing and skillful relationship to his passions, not that he is startled by them.",

At night the wide and level stretch of wold, Which at high noon had basked in quiet gold, Far as the eye could see was ghostly white; Dark was the night save for the snow’s weird light. I drew the shades far down, crept into bed; Hearing the cold wind moaning overhead Through the sad pines, my soul, catching its pain, Went sorrowing with it across the plain. As used in the text, what does the word “drew” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Pulled",
    optionB: "B. Drained",
    optionC: "C. Inspired",
    optionD: "D. Sketched",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “drew” most nearly means pulled. In the text, the speaker stands at a window, looking out on a landscape at night. The speaker then “drew the shades far down, crept into bed.” That is, the speaker pulled down, or lowered, the shades until they were completely shut before going to sleep. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “drew” can refer to draining or removing liquid, especially water, as when someone draws water from a well, in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. Choice C is incorrect. In some contexts, “drew” can be used to describe how a person or thing inspires, or elicits, a response from someone, as when a performer draws applause from an audience. But in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. Choice D is incorrect.

In hours of toil it gives me zest, And when at eve I long for rest; When cows come home along the bars, And in the fold I hear the bell, As Night, the shepherd, herds his stars, I sing my song, and all is well. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA: "A. To convey how engaging in song makes the speaker feel",
    optionB: "B. To compare the speaker to a singing shepherd",
    optionC: "C. To portray the speaker’s excitement about farming",
    optionD: "D. To describe the pieces of music the speaker enjoys hearing",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because is accurately states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by declaring that although a song is "but a little thing," or seemingly insignicant, singing it brings joy and gives the speaker of the text "zest," or excitement, in "hours of toil." The remainder of the text explores the idea that as night is falling, singing allows the speaker to feel that "all is well." Thus, the main purpose of the text is to convey how engaging in song makes the speaker feel. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions a shepherd, it neither indicates that the shepherd is singing nor does it compare the shepherd to the speaker. Choice C is incorrect. The text indicates that the speaker works hard, engaging in "hours of toil," and it can be inferred that the speaker likely lives in a rural area, since cows and a cowbell can be heard nearby. However, the text does not suggest that the speaker is a farmer or feels excited about farming. Moreover, the shepherd in the text is not a literal reference to someone who herds sheep but instead a gurative description of the moon as the shepherd of the stars. Choice D is incorrect because in the text, the speaker is singing a song, not listening to others sing one. Moreover, the text describes the feelings that the speaker has when singing a song, not the song itself.',

    optionA: "A. complementary",
    optionB: "B. unknown",
    optionC: "C. disparate",
    optionD: "D. interchangeable",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the artistic styles that have inuenced Cannon’s work. As used in this context, “disparate” means distinct or dissimilar. The text indicates that a tension exists among the styles that have inuenced Cannon’s work and goes on to describe how those styles differ: classic European portraiture favors realism, American pop art uses vivid colors, and intertribal atstyle rejects the use of shading and perspective to achieve depth. This context suggests that the styles that have inuenced Cannon’s work are disparate. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the inuences on Cannon’s artwork, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that the inuences are “complementary,” or that they complete one another or make up for one another’s deciencies. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to characterize Cannon’s inuences as “unknown,” or not familiar; it’s clear that the inuences are known because the text goes on to list them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the inuences on Cannon’s work, not that they are “interchangeable,” or capable of being used in one another’s place.",

In the 1970s, Latina artists painted vivid scenes of community life on walls along this block. As the original murals have faded, later generations of artists have painted new ones over them. As a result, Balmy Alley has become a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit, with its murals reecting changes in the cultural life of the city. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:

      "C. To urge people to protect the murals of San Francisco from decay",
    optionD:
      "D. To describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco beginning in the 1970s",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by briey stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city’s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are signicant because they reect San Francisco’s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals. Choice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn’t specically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specic collection of murals—or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as “a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit,” the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specic area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District.",

    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately states the text’s main purpose. The poem begins with the speaker urging a child to “go forth” with her encouragement (“my heart’s desire”). The speaker goes on to suggest that new experiences (“Great reaches, yet unknown”) lie ahead for the son that “life is calling” him to seek out. Thus, the main purpose is to encourage a child to embrace the experiences available to him in his life. Choice A is incorrect because the speaker encourages the child to pursue new experiences (“Great reaches”) without knowing exactly what those experiences will be (“yet unknown”) or suggesting that they should match the speaker’s own accomplishments. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker focuses on positive possibilities for her son (“Great reaches, yet unknown”) and her enthusiastic encouragement to embrace those possibilities (“life is calling you!”), while there is no mention of raising a child or associated struggles.

      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of studies of altitude’s effect on blood chemistry. In this context, “paucity of” means lack of. In describing the inspiration behind Al-Sweedan and Alhaj’s research, the text uses the word “though” to suggest a contrasting relationship between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. This contrasting relationship and the text’s use of the word “many” provide context suggesting that there are few, if any, examples of the second type of study, whereas there are numerous examples of the rst type. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for there to be a “quarrel about,” or open disagreement about, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text’s use of the words “though” and “many” suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. There’s nothing in the text to suggest that the contrast between the two types of studies involves the extent to which researchers broadly agree or disagree about the contents of either type. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for there to be a “profusion of,” or great abundance of, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text’s use of the words “though” and “many” suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. Rather than logically completing this contrast, “profusion of” would indicate that the two types of studies are similar in terms of amount, with many examples existing of both types. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for there to be a “verisimilitude in,” or appearance of truth in, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text’s use of the words “though” and “many” suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. There’s nothing in the text to suggest that the contrast between the two types of studies involves the extent to which either type of study presents an appearance of truth.",

    question:
      "Musician Joni Mitchell, who is also a painter, uses images she creates for her album covers to emphasize ideas expressed in her music. For the cover of her album Turbulent Indigo (1994), Mitchell painted a striking self-portrait that closely resembles Vincent van Gogh’s Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear (1889). The image calls attention to the album’s title song, in which Mitchell sings about the legacy of the postimpressionist painter. In that song, Mitchell also hints that she feels a strong artistic connection to Van Gogh—an idea that is reinforced by her imagery on the cover. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. It presents a claim about Mitchell, then gives an example supporting that claim.",
    optionB:
      "B. It discusses Van Gogh’s inuence on Mitchell, then considers Mitchell’s inuence on other artists.",
    optionC:
      "C. It describes a similarity between two artists, then notes a difference between them.",
    optionD:
      "D. It describes the songs on Turbulent Indigo, then explains how they relate to the album’s cover.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it accurately describes the organization of the elements within the text. The text begins with the claim that Joni Mitchell’s album covers use images she creates in order to emphasize ideas embedded in her albums. It then goes on to provide an example of how Mitchell’s self-portrait on the cover of Turbulent Indigo resembles a painting by Van Gogh, which the text indicates helps emphasize the strong connection Mitchell feels toward Van Gogh, a connection that is also expressed in the album’s title song. Choice B is incorrect because there are no references in the text to artists other than Joni Mitchell and Van Gogh. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text that calls attention to any similarities or differences between Joni Mitchell and Van Gogh. Instead, it mentions that Mitchell feels a strong “artistic connection” to Van Gogh. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses the cover before referring to any songs, and it only references one song from the album not all the songs.",

      "The following text is from the 1924 poem “Cycle” by D’Arcy McNickle, who was a citizen of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. There shall be new roads wending, A new beating of the drum— Men’s eyes shall have fresh seeing, Grey lives reprise their span— But under the new sun’s being, Completing what night began, There’ll be the same backs bending, The same sad feet shall drum— When this night nds its ending And day shall have come.....

    optionD:
      "D. To demonstrate how the experiences of individuals relate to the experiences of their communities",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it accurately states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by discussing the promise of the future, with positive references to renewal such as “new roads,” “new beating of the drum,” and “fresh seeing.” But with the “new sun,” the text continues, there will still be “the same backs bending” and “the same sad feet” drumming, indicating that these diculties will follow people into this new day. The poem thus considers both the rewards and challenges associated with the repetitiveness of human life. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t say anything about how memorable activities are, let alone compare the memorability of activities completed at different times of the day. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text contrasts hope with diculty, it does not compare the relative frequency of joyful feelings with that of sad feelings. Choice D is incorrect because the text makes no distinction between the experiences of individuals and the experiences of their communities.",

    question:
      "In habitats with limited nutrients, certain fungus species grow on the roots of trees, engaging in mutually benecial relationships known as ectomycorrhizae: in this symbiotic exchange, the tree provides the fungus with carbon, a nutrient necessary for both species, and the fungus ______ by enhancing the tree’s ability to absorb nitrogen, another key nutrient, from the soil. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. overreacts",
    optionB: "B. reciprocates",
    optionC: "C. retaliates",
    optionD: "D. deviates",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of ectomycorrhizae relationships. In this context, “reciprocates” means responds in kind or degree. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is “mutually benecial” and involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. In other words, each organism provides the same kind of benet it receives: the tree provides a nutrient (carbon) for the fungus and the fungus reciprocates by helping the tree to absorb more of another nutrient (nitrogen). Choice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Nothing in the text suggests that the fungus “overreacts,” or responds too strongly, by allowing the tree to be better able to absorb a benecial nutrient. Choice C is incorrect because “retaliates” means responds to a harmful action with a similarly harmful action. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is “mutually benecial” and involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other, not that the relationship is one in which the organisms harm one another. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “deviates” would mean departs from an established course or norm. The text explains that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Because the relationship involves benets for both the fungus and the tree, it wouldn’t make sense to say that the fungus deviates by helping the tree be better able to absorb a benecial nutrient.",

      "Generally it takes Tule geese about four days to migrate south for the winter. From their summer breeding grounds in Cook Inlet, Alaska, the birds begin by ying over the Gulf of Alaska, keeping about 100 miles from the Canadian shore. They pause to rest on the Pacic Ocean, then y toward Summer Lake, Oregon, before nally arriving at their winter destination of Sacramento Valley, California. In 2020, however, it took the geese over twice as long to make their way from Cook Inlet to Sacramento Valley. According to researchers, the reason was airborne pollutants. Which choice best states the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",
    optionA: "A. ",
    optionB: "B. It suggests an explanation for why Tule geese breed in Alask",
    optionC:
      "C. It describes part of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration journey.",
    optionD:
      "D. It compares Tule geese to other birds that migrate south for the winter.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it best states how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence states that Tule geese typically take four days to migrate south. Then in the next sentence, which contains the underlined portion, the text describes the rst part of that journey, which begins with the geese ying over the Gulf of Alaska while keeping about 100 miles from the Canadian shore. The rest of the text details the remainder of the geese’s typical journey and then mentions circumstances in 2020 that resulted in the geese taking an unusually long time to complete it. Thus, the underlined portion describes part of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration journey. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text concludes by stating that in 2020, Tule geese took twice as long to complete their typical migration, which suggests a change in their usual ight behavior, the underlined portion doesn’t discuss this. Instead, the underlined portion describes the rst part of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration journey over the Gulf of Alaska. Choice B is incorrect. Although the sentence containing the underlined portion mentions that Tule geese breed in Alaska, the underlined portion doesn’t explain why the geese breed in that location. Rather, the text mentions Alaska to explain that it’s the starting point of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t discuss any other birds that migrate south for the winter. In fact, the text is only concerned with the migration of Tule geese.",

    optionA: "A. genuine",
    optionB: "B. intentional",
    optionC: "C. independent",
    optionD: "D. original",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the dating of Machu Picchu. In this context, "original" means rst or initial. The text indicates that Lucy Salazar and her colleagues have determined the age of Machu Picchu and that the age differs from another estimate of the site’s age, explaining that the site is about 20 years older than scholars thought in 1911 when they initially encountered Machu Picchu. In other words, Salazar and her team found that the site’s age differs from the rst estimate. Choice A is incorrect. The text’s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they rst encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. It wouldn’t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was "genuine," or actual and true, while the one by Salazar’s team wasn’t, since the text treats the nding by Salazar’s team as true and as invalidating the earlier estimate ("it is approximately 20 years older than scholars thought"). Choice B is incorrect. The text’s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they rst encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. It wouldn’t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was "intentional," or done on purpose, while the one by Salazar’s team wasn’t; the text indicates that Salazar and her colleagues were deliberately using radiocarbon dating to study Machu Picchu. Choice C is incorrect. The text’s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they rst encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. There’s no reason to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was "independent," or not controlled by or aliated with others, while the one by Salazar’s team wasn’t; there’s no mention of any outside inuence on the work by Salazar and her team or by scholars in 1911.',

    optionD:
      "D. It contrasts Keyboard Fantasies with the recordings of two younger musicians.",
    correctAnswer: 2,

      "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole. The text’s subject is Beverly GlennCopeland’s 1986 album Keyboard Fantasies, notable for its innovative, experimental arrangements. According to the text, the album was not initially admired, but in recent years it has become popular among younger musicians. The underlined portion of the text mentions two of those musicians, Blood Orange and Moses Sumney, who “cite the album as an inuence.” Therefore, the underlined portion of the text offers examples of younger musicians whose work has been impacted by Keyboard Fantasies.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. indulge",
    optionB: "B. despise",
    optionC: "C. moderate",
    optionD: "D. criticize",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. In this context, "indulge" means treat with excessive leniency. The text states that according to historian Edward Gibbon, Marcus Aurelius, who was widely considered virtuous, had only a single character aw: his mild temperament. The text suggests that because of this aw, Marcus Aurelius had an overly permissive nature. This context, in turn, supports the idea that Marcus Aurelius treated the vices, or evils, of those around him with excessive leniency, indulging rather than punishing those vices. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Marcus Aurelius was widely considered virtuous, it gives no indication that he was inclined to "despise," or hate, others’ vices. Rather, the text suggests that he showed undue tolerance for these vices because of his overly permissive nature—that is, his inclination to allow others to do as they wished. Choice C is incorrect because the text’s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others’ vices, not that he tried to "moderate" those vices, or lessen their intensity. Choice D is incorrect because the text’s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others’ vices, not that he attempted to "criticize," or speak disapprovingly of, those vices.',

Choice B is incorrect. "Preguring" means "being an early indicator of." There already existed views of Vermeer as a solitary painter, so a new painting would not be an early indicator of those views. Rather, a painting proving that Vermeer had a student would contradict those earlier views. Choice C is incorrect. "Entrenching" means "solidifying."

    optionB: "B. rejection",
    optionC: "C. imitation",
    optionD: "D. opinion",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of novelist Leon Forrest’s admiration of William Faulkner’s writing style. In this context, "imitation" means something that resembles or reproduces something else. The text states that Forrest admired Faulkner’s style and that anyone familiar with Faulkner’s style would be able to see the stylistic similarities between a particular passage in Forrest’s novel Divine Days and Faulkner’s writing, a fact that supports the idea that Forrest’s novel pays tribute to Faulkner by reproducing, or imitating, Faulkner’s style. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, a "forgetting" would mean an instance in which something is overlooked or not remembered. The text emphasizes Forrest’s admiration for Faulkner’s style and the fact that Forrest’s writing in some instances closely resembles Faulkner’s stylistically. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that in trying to pay tribute to Faulkner’s style, Forrest failed to remember it. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, a "rejection" would mean a dismissal of something as unworthy. The text emphasizes Forrest’s admiration for Faulkner’s writing style, stating that parts of Forrest’s writings indicate efforts to copy that style. It wouldn’t make sense therefore to suggest that Forrest had rejected or dismissed Faulkner’s style as unworthy. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, an "opinion" would mean a view or judgment. Although the text focuses on Forrest’s admiration of Faulkner, which suggests that Forrest had formed a positive judgment of Faulkner’s style, the word opinion wouldn’t make sense in this sentence: the sentence doesn’t say that the passage from Forrest’s novel expresses his view of Faulkner’s style; rather, it suggests that stylistically, the passage closely resembles, or imitates, Faulkner’s writing.',

    optionB: "B. comparable to",
    optionC: "C. independent of",
    optionD: "D. obtained from",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the fossilized bones of the hominin known as Little Foot. As used in this context, “comparable to” would mean similar to. The text indicates that the relationship between the fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones of Little Foot and the clavicle and shoulder bones of “frequent climbers,” such as chimpanzees and gorillas, suggests that Little Foot had adapted to moving around in trees. This context suggests that the relationship between the fossilized bones of Little Foot and the bones of chimpanzees and gorillas is one of similarity—the Little Foot fossils are likely comparable to the modern ape bones. Choice A is incorrect because if the fossilized bones of Little Foot were “surpassed by,” or exceeded by or made inferior to, the bones of modern apes that are frequent climbers, it wouldn’t suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees. If anything, learning that Little Foot’s clavicle and shoulder bones were surpassed by those of chimpanzees and gorillas would suggest that Little Foot was poorly adapted to climbing. Choice C is incorrect because if Little Foot’s fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones were “independent of,” or not inuenced by or aliated with, the bones of modern apes that climb often, it wouldn’t suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees.

    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the play’s effect on audiences. As used in this context, “rousing” means exciting or energizing. The text indicates that critics found the play to have “the opposite effect” on audiences of what the playwrights hoped for. The critics, the text says, thought the play was wearying rather than energizing to viewers. This context supports the idea that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be energizing, or rousing, to audiences. Choice A is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be “multifaceted,” or be varied or have many aspects. The text indicates that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Multifaceted is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing.

Realistic is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be subtle, or complex or understated. The text says that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for.

      'Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "featured" most nearly means displayed. The text describes Nina’s fascination with a framed photograph. It then goes on to describe what the photograph showed, or displayed, which is a portrait of Nina’s great-great-grandmother Rosita as a young woman. Thus, the text indicates that the photograph displayed a portrait of Rosita. Choice B is incorrect because the text identies the person shown in the photograph as Nina’s great-great-grandmother; it gives no indication that the contents of the photograph were questioned, or asked about. Choice C is incorrect because approved means expressed a favorable opinion of, and there’s nothing to suggest that the photograph of Nina’s great-great-grandmother has received approval or been viewed favorably, only that Nina is unable to stop looking at it. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the photograph Nina is fascinated with ignored, or refused to take notice of, Nina’s great-great-grandmother Rosita. Rather, the text indicates that the photograph was a portrait of Rosita.',

    question:
      "Text 1 The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event is usually attributed solely to an asteroid impact near Chicxulub, Mexico. Some scientists argue that volcanic activity was the true cause, as the K-Pg event occurred relatively early in a long period of eruption of the Deccan Traps range that initially produced huge amounts of climate-altering gases. These dissenters note that other mass extinctions have coincided with large volcanic eruptions, while only the K-Pg event lines up with an asteroid strike. Text 2 In a 2020 study, Pincelli Hull and her colleagues analyzed ocean core samples and modeled climate changes around the K-Pg event. The team concluded that Deccan Traps gases did affect global conditions prior to the event, but that the climate returned to normal well before the extinctions began—extinctions that instead closely align with the Chicxulub impact. Based on the texts, how would Hull’s team (Text 2) most likely respond to the argument in the underlined portion of Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By agreeing that the Chicxulub impact changed the climate and that the Deccan Traps eruption caused the K-Pg event",
    optionB:
      "B. By declaring that the changes in climate caused by the Deccan Traps eruption weren’t the main cause of the K-Pg event",
    optionC:
      "C. By questioning why those scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps eruption",
    optionD:
      "D. By asserting that the Deccan Traps eruption had a more signicant effect on global conditions than those scientists claim",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it describes how Hull’s team would most likely respond to the argument in the underlined portion of Text 1, which asserts that volcanic activity in the Deccan Traps range led to changes in the climate and caused the K-Pg mass extinction event. According to Text 2, although Hull’s team found that activity in the Deccan Traps did indeed alter the climate before the K-Pg event, the team determined that the climate had returned to normal before mass extinctions began. This nding and the observation that the K-Pg extinctions closely align with the Chicxulub asteroid impact suggest that Hull’s team would likely dispute the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 and say that the climate changes caused by the Deccan Traps activity were not the main cause of the extinctions. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull’s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull’s team would disagree that the Deccan Traps activity caused the K-Pg event. Additionally, the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 says nothing about how the Chicxulub impact changed the climate, so while Hull’s team might believe that the impact did in fact change the climate, they could not be said to agree with the claim in Text 1 on this point. Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication in either text that any scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps activity, so there is no reason to conclude that Hull’s team would question why the scientists referred to in Text 1 make such an assumption. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull’s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull’s team would say that the Deccan Traps activity had a less enduring effect on global conditions than the scientists referenced in Text 1 believe, not that the effect on global conditions was more signicant than those scientists claim.",

      "In most building demolitions, the building materials are destroyed and sent to landlls. City ocials in Portland, Oregon, wanted to reduce this waste. The ocials passed a law requiring demolition companies to deconstruct some buildings instead. Deconstruction involves carefully taking buildings apart piece by piece. Damage to the materials is avoided so that they can be reused in new constructions. A 2019 study found that 27 percent of materials from deconstructions in Portland were able to be reused. The remaining materials were processed for recycling instead of going to a landll. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To explain an effort made by the city of Portland to reduce demolition waste and some results of that effort",
    optionB:
      "B. To show that popular support for measures that reduce demolition waste has increased since 2019",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. a suitable",
    optionB: "B. a determined",
    optionC: "C. an arbitrary",
    optionD: "D. an unpredictable",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. “Suitable” means “appropriate for a particular purpose.” Since the text indicates that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage, we can infer that the author believes that ballet is a very suitable artform for telling Osage stories. Choice B is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith’s choice was determined. That would imply that Tinker-Smith initially faced some kind of obstacle or opposition, and nothing like that is mentioned in the passage. Choice C is incorrect. The text implies the opposite of this. “Arbitrary” means “based on random choice or whim rather than reason.” But the text does give us a good reason behind the choice to tell Osage stories through ballet: two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage. Choice D is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith’s choice was “unpredictable.” Rather, the fact that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage makes ballet especially appropriate for telling Osage stories.",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. indecipherable",
    optionB: "B. ornamental",
    optionC: "C. obscure",
    optionD: "D. intricate",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Three Sisters intercropping system. As used in this context, “intricate” would mean made up of complexly related elements. The text indicates that in the Three Sisters system, maize, squash, and beans form a “web of relations” in which the crops interact in various ways. The text’s description of these interactions—the bean vines growing on the maize stalks, the squash vines keeping weeds away, and the beans adding nutrients that the maize and squash use—provides context suggesting that this “web of relations” is intricate. Choice A is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as “indecipherable,” or impossible to comprehend, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text’s description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not indecipherable. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the practical benets that each plant in the Three Sisters system provides to other members of the system, showing that the relationship among the crops that make up the system is not “ornamental,” or mainly serving a decorative purpose. Choice C is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as “obscure,” or unknown or poorly understood, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text’s description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not obscure.",

    optionD:
      "D. It describes the event that led the narrator’s parents to buy a piano.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is to establish the narrator’s feelings about the piano. The narrator reveals that she “had to act really happy” about the piano even though she “pretty much hated the thing” as soon as it was placed upstairs near her bedroom. The narrator also describes the piano as glaring at her and compares it to a caged bird that wants to be set free. These details establish the narrator’s feelings about the piano, suggesting that it makes her uneasy. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the narrator hated having the piano upstairs right next to her bedroom, not that she wanted a piano to be close to her bedroom. Choice C is incorrect because the only information provided in the text about the narrator’s brothers is that they were given the piano along with the narrator.

    optionB: "B. partnership",
    optionC: "C. discovery",
    optionD: "D. disagreement",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the cover art of Virginia Woolf’s novels. In this context, “partnership” means collaboration or joint effort. The text states that Woolf’s sister Vanessa Bell was a talented painter and that Bell worked with Woolf to provide the cover art for most of Woolf’s novels. Thus, this context suggests that Woolf and Bell pursued a creative partnership in order to produce several of Woolf’s novels. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Woolf or Bell were undergoing a “rebellion,” or revolt, against anything in particular. Instead, the text focuses on how they worked together in some aspects of the production of Woolf’s novels. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that Woolf or Bell made a “discovery,” or encountered anything new for the rst time as they worked together.

    optionB: "B. individualistic",
    optionC: "C. theoretical",
    optionD: "D. homogeneous",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the art at the National Museum of the American Indian. In this context, "homogenous" means uniform or highly similar. The text explains that the painters whose works are included in this museum’s collection employ an array of artistic styles, both Native and non-Native, traditional and new. Given this high degree of stylistic diversity, it is a misconception that Native art is uniform, or homogenous. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t consider whether Native art is controversial, or causes disagreement or discussion; instead, the text discusses the stylistic diversity of the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some of the artists whose work is represented in the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian blend various artistic traditions into highly individual styles of their own, this is not the primary focus of the text. Instead, the text is concerned with how Native art is often mistakenly perceived as uniform, when in fact it is stylistically diverse. Choice C is incorrect because the text never implies that people mistakenly conceive of Native art as theoretical, or concerned with philosophical or abstract issues; instead, the text’s discussion of Native art is framed around this art’s stylistic diversity versus the misconception of it as homogenous.',

CECILY: It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very brief space of time. The absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable. As used in the text, what does the word “endure” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Regret",
    optionB: "B. Persist",
    optionC: "C. Tolerate",
    optionD: "D. Encourage",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “endure” most nearly means tolerate. In the text, Cecily and Algernon discuss parting, or saying goodbye. Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known briey and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable. Choice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “endure” can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist despite the absence of someone else, one can’t persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent. Although it may be that Cecily prefers new acquaintances to friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses on her feelings as a result of others’ absences, not on her treatment of others.",

Many insist that bluegrass is dened by its adherence to the folk music of the US South, out of which bluegrass emerged. Such “purists,” as they are known, regard the recordings of Bill Monroe, which established the bluegrass sound in the 1940s, as a standard against which the genre should still be measured. Text 2 Bluegrass isn’t simply an extension of folk traditions into the era of recorded music. In reality, Bill Monroe created the bluegrass sound in the 1940s by combining Southern folk music with commercial genres that had arisen only a few decades before, such as jazz and the blues. Since bluegrass has always been a mixed genre, contemporary bluegrass musicians should not be forbidden from incorporating into it inuences from rock and other mainstream genres.

      "Text 1 Stage lighting theorist Adolphe Appia was perhaps the rst to argue that light must be considered alongside all the various elements of a stage to create a single, unied performance. Researcher Kelly Bremner, however, has noted that Appia lacked technical expertise in the use of light in the theater. As a result of Appia’s inexperience, Bremner argues, Appia’s theory of light called for lighting practices that weren’t possible until after the advent of electricity around 1881. Text 2 Adolphe Appia was not an amateur in the practice of lighting. Instead, it is precisely his exposure to lighting techniques at the time that contributed to his theory on the importance of light. When working as an apprentice for a lighting specialist in his youth, Appia observed the use of portable lighting devices that could be operated by hand. This experience developed his understanding of what was possible in the coordination of elements on the stage. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claim about Appia’s level of technical expertise made by Bremner in Text 1?",

    optionC: "C. prediction",
    optionD: "D. moderation",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of a relationship between the dodder plant and its host plant. As used in this context, “synchronization” means the act of things happening at the same time. The text indicates that the dodder and its host plant ower in unison and that this synchronization occurs because the dodder makes use of a protein produced by the host shortly before owering. Choice B is incorrect because referring to “hibernation,” or the state of being dormant or inactive, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on something the dodder plant actively engages in—making use of a protein and producing owers. Choice C is incorrect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage together in “prediction,” or the act of declaring or indicating something in advance, wouldn’t make sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant make a prediction about owering activity, the text suggests that the host produces a protein as part of its regular owering process and that the dodder then absorbs and uses that protein to ower at the same time. Choice D is incorrect because referring to “moderation,” or the act of causing something to become less intense or extreme, wouldn’t make sense in context. Although the text states that the dodder plant absorbs and uses a protein made by its host plant, it doesn’t suggest that the dodder lessens the host plant’s owering activity; the two plants simply ower in unison.",

      "D. The author of Text 1 believes that the moon formed more slowly than the author of Text 2 believes.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. Text 1 states that the moon was formed from the debris “over the course of thousands of years,” while Text 2 states that the moon’s formation happened “immediately after impact, taking just a few hours.” This shows a clear difference in how the authors view the evidence for the speed of the moon’s formation. Choice A is incorrect. While Text 2 suggests that the moon formed over “just a few hours” and Text 1 says it took “thousands of years,” neither one mentions when that formation occurred. Choice B is incorrect. While Theia isn’t mentioned in Text 2, neither text describes or disputes evidence of Theia’s existence. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text makes any claims about the similarity or difference between the moon’s surface and Earth’s surface.",

      "The following text is adapted from Elizabeth von Arnim’s 1922 novel The Enchanted April. Mrs. Wilkins and her friend Rose are traveling in Italy. “I’m going to have one of these gorgeous oranges,” said Mrs. Wilkins, staying where she was and reaching across to a black bowl piled with them. “Rose, how can you resist them. Look—have this one. Do have this beauty—” And she held out a big one. As used in the text, what does the phrase “reaching across to” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Joining with",
    optionB: "B. Gaining on",
    optionC: "C. Stretching toward",
    optionD: "D. Arriving at",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text "reaching across to" most nearly means stretching toward. The text begins with Mrs. Wilkins stating that she wants to have one of the oranges that she’s admiring. The text then indicates that Mrs. Wilkins, staying where she is, holds out a big orange to her friend. This context suggests that when the text describes Mrs. Wilkins as reaching across to the bowl of oranges, it means that she is stretching toward the bowl. Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is joining with, or becoming attached to, the bowl of oranges. Rather, the text indicates that she is stretching toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is gaining on, or overtaking in a competition or race, the bowl of oranges. The text suggests instead that the bowl is sitting still on a surface and that Mrs. Wilkins is extending her arm toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Mrs. Wilkins is arriving at the bowl of oranges. In fact, the text states that Mrs. Wilkins stays where she is when reaching across to the bowl, meaning that she remains at a distance from it.',

      "Were penguins always ightless? Theresa Cole and her team argue that penguins could y at some point, but that they lost that ability more than 60 million years ago as they adapted to marine life. After examining various penguin fossils and genetic information, the researchers concluded that over time penguins developed underwater vision, blood oxygenation, and bone density better suited for swimming than ying. Thus, environmental conditions might have driven penguins to change from yers to swimmers. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?",
    optionA: "A. It denes a scientic term used in the sentence that follows.",
    optionB: "B. It contradicts a description in the sentence that follows.",
    optionC:
      "C. It provides an answer to the question in the previous sentence.",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text begins with a question: have penguins always been unable to y? The underlined sentence then presents an answer that has been offered by researchers, indicating that Theresa Cole and her team believe that penguins were once able to y but lost that ability long ago as they began living in the sea. The text then describes the research that led to that answer. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to provide an answer to the question in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect because none of the terms used in the sentence that follows are dened in the underlined sentence; no denitions are given at all. Instead, the sentence presents Theresa Cole and her team’s answer to the earlier question about penguins’ ability to y. Choice B is incorrect because there is no contradiction between the underlined sentence and the sentence that follows since both convey that at some point penguins underwent adaptations that limited their ability to y and helped them swim and live in the sea. Instead of contradicting later information, the underlined sentence presents an answer to the earlier question about penguins’ ability to y. Choice D is incorrect because the question in the previous sentence is about penguins’ ability to y and the underlined sentence presents Theresa Cole and her team’s answer to that question based on their research into penguin ight, which is described in the rest of the text.",

    optionC: "C. inherited",
    optionD: "D. overlooked",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the contributions of the Sumerian civilization. In this context, “introduced” means brought into practice or use. The text states that the rst reference to a seven-day week appears in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh. The text presents this information about the seven-day week as an example of a concept introduced by the Sumerian civilization that persists into present-day civilizations. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Sumerian civilization “transformed,” or changed the nature of, concepts that persist into presentday civilizations. Instead, the text’s presentation of a Sumerian literary work that contains the rst description of the seven-day week is an example of the phenomenon described in the rst half of the sentence, suggesting that the Sumerians invented many concepts that still persist. Choice C is incorrect because the information that a Sumerian literary work includes the rst description of the seven-day week suggests that Sumerian civilization may have originated the sevenday week and other concepts that persist into present-day civilizations, not that it “inherited” the concepts, or received them from an ancestral gure or culture. Choice D is incorrect because the information that Sumerian civilization produced the rst description of the seven-day week is presented as an example of the phenomenon described in the rst half of the sentence, suggesting that Sumerian civilization originated this and other concepts that still persist, not that the Sumerians “overlooked,” or failed to notice or consider, such concepts.",

    optionA: "A. foundational",
    optionB: "B. supplementary",
    optionC: "C. repetitive",
    optionD: "D. ineffective",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of physicist Joseph Webster’s research on gravitational waves. In this context “foundational” means the basis on which something else develops. The text indicates that Webster’s experiments in the 1960s and 1970s were earlier than, and “key” to, the work of later scientists in the eld; thus, Webster’s work was foundational to the later scientists’ experiments and the eventual detection of a gravitational wave in 2015. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Webster’s work was supplementary, or an additional element of an existing, larger project, but rather it was “the basis for” later experiments. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not assert that Webster’s work was repetitive, or involved doing something the same way many times. Rather, the text indicates that Webster’s work formed the basis for later investigations in the eld of gravitational wave research. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not state that Webster’s work was ineffective, or failed to produce the desired outcome.

Making the social sciences more responsive to Indians’ needs, Mukerjee argued, required constructing analytical categories informed by India’s cultural and ecological circumstances. Mukerjee thus proposed the communalist “Indian village” as the ideal model on which to base Indian economic and social policy. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",

The standards of my own and my adopted country differed so widely in some ways, and my love for both lands was so sincere, that sometimes I had an odd feeling of standing upon a cloud in space, and gazing with measuring eyes upon two separate worlds. At rst I was continually trying to explain, by Japanese standards, all the queer things that came every day before my surprised eyes; for no one seemed to know the origin or signicance of even the most familiar customs, nor why they existed and were followed. Which choice best describes the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To convey the narrator’s experience of observing and making sense of differences between two cultures she embraces",
    optionB:
      "B. To establish the narrator’s hope of forming connections with new companions by sharing customs she learned as a child",

    optionD:
      "D. To emphasize the narrator’s wonder at discovering that the physical distance between two countries is greater than she had expected",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The narrator asserts that she loves both her “own” country (Japan) and her “adopted country” (the United States) even though the two countries differ “widely.” She also indicates that, at rst, she would try to explain unfamiliar experiences that she had in the United States using the standards ingrained in her from growing up in Japan. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to convey the narrator’s experience of observing and making sense of the differences between two cultures she embraces. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to possible companions. Although the text does indicate that the narrator sometimes used the cultural framework she acquired growing up in Japan to explain some experiences she’s had, there is no suggestion that this was in service of making friends. And although “no one seemed to know” strongly implies that the narrator has interacted with other people in the United States, there is no indication that these conversations involved her discussing Japanese customs. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator was hesitant to ask questions. In fact, the narrator indicates that “no one seemed to know the origin” of various customs, which provides evidence that, rather than being hesitant, she sought information from several people. Choice D is incorrect because the text makes no reference to the physical distance between Japan and the United States. Although the narrator indicates that the two countries differ “widely” and likens them to “two separate worlds,” these descriptions relate to cultural aspects of the countries and the narrator’s feelings about the two countries, not the physical distance between them.",

The most enduring example of this idea is Margaret Wise Brown’s 1947 picture book Goodnight Moon, in which a young rabbit names the objects in his room as he drifts off to sleep.

    optionA: "A. creative",
    optionB: "B. bold",
    optionC: "C. traditional",
    optionD: "D. understandable",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Helen Liu Fong’s architectural designs. In this context, “traditional” means conventional. The text states that rather than use “standard shapes and colors,” Fong pursued “innovative” and “daring” design choices in her work. Fong’s style is depicted as inventive, so it therefore makes sense in this context that she avoided mainstream, traditional designs in her buildings. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong’s work is innovative and experimental. Thus, Fong’s design choices could reasonably be considered creative, or original. She likely would have pursued creative designs, not avoided them. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong used “daring” hues in her designs. Thus, Fong likely would have pursued bold, or brave and vivid design choices; she wouldn’t have avoided them.

    optionC: "C. unimportant",
    optionD: "D. appropriate",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the sentence about the inuences on Banisadr’s work. In context, “It is by no means” followed by “unimportant” conveys how it is relevant to recognize Bosch’s inuence on Banisadr. The text points out that the artist himself cites Bosch as an inspiration, and then goes on to claim that The Epic of Gilgamesh has had a more signicant inuence than Bosch. Choice A is incorrect because “substantial,” which means weighty or meaningful, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn’t be meaningful to acknowledge Bosch’s inuence on Banisadr. The phrase “indeed, Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration” doesn’t support this suggestion. Choice B is incorrect because “satisfying,” which means pleasing, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn’t be pleasing to acknowledge Bosch’s inuence on Banisadr.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text’s overall portrayal of how the women in Ohiyesa’s tribe harvested maple syrup. The text states that the women used an axe to strike the maple trees in order to nd out which ones would produce sap. The underlined sentence compares the trees to people, with the sap described as the trees’ “life-blood.” Some of the trees are ready to give out their sap, while others are unwilling to do so. Using personication, the sentence provides greater detail about the aspect of the maple trees—their potential to give sap—that the women are evaluating. Choice A is incorrect because the personalities of the women are not discussed in the text. Although the underlined sentence does mention “individual characters,” this reference is not to the women in the text but rather to the maple trees, which the sentence compares to people with individual character traits.

    optionC: "C. indications of",
    optionD: "D. similarities with",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because in context, sharing "similarities with" means having some resemblance to. The text establishes a comparison between two groups of mammals, stating that although they aren’t closely related, hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs play similar roles in their habitats, a circumstance that has resulted in the independent development of some of the same physical traits. This context supports the idea that hedgehog tenrecs resemble, or share basic similarities with, true hedgehogs in some respects. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that hedgehog tenrecs are "examples of," or representative of, true hedgehogs. The text states that despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren’t closely related; therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can’t be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "concerns about" would mean worries about or interests in. The text focuses on the various physical traits that hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs share. There’s nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs, or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "indications of" would mean evidence of. By listing a set of traits that hedgehog tenrecs share with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the two groups of mammals, and saying that the traits shared within one group of mammals provide evidence of another group of mammals wouldn’t be an effective way to establish the similarities between the two groups.',

      "Text 1 In 2021, a team led by Amir Siraj hypothesized that the Chicxulub impactor—the object that struck the Yucatán Peninsula sixty-six million years ago, precipitating the mass extinction of the dinosaurs—was likely a member of the class of long-period comets. As evidence, Siraj cited the carbonaceous chondritic composition of samples from the Chicxulub impact crater as well as of samples obtained from long-period comet Wild 2 in 2006. Text 2 Although long-period comets contain carbonaceous chondrites, asteroids are similarly rich in these materials. Furthermore, some asteroids are rich in iridium, as Natalia Artemieva points out, whereas long-period comets are not. Given the prevalence of iridium at the crater and, more broadly, in geological layers deposited worldwide following the impact, Artemieva argues that an asteroid is a more plausible candidate for the Chicxulub impactor. Based on the texts, how would Artemieva likely respond to Siraj’s hypothesis, as presented in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By insisting that it overestimates how representative Wild 2 is of long-period comets as a class",
    optionB:

    optionD:
      "D. By concurring that carbonaceous chondrites are prevalent in soil samples from sites distant from the Chicxulub crater",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. Siraj’s hypothesis is that the Chicxulub impactor was a long-period comet. But Artemieva points to the iridium found in the crater and in “geological layers that were deposited worldwide after the impact” as evidence that it was actually an asteroid, not a long-period comet. Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj’s hypothesis. Text 2 never discusses whether Wild 2 is representative of longperiod comets in general. Rather, Text 2 presents Artemieva’s argument that the Chicxulub impactor was an asteroid, not a long-term comet. Choice C is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj’s hypothesis. Siraj’s hypothesis doesn’t make this connection: rather, Siraj hypothesizes that the Chicxulub impactor was a long-term comet. Choice D is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj’s hypothesis. “Soil samples from sites distant from the Chicxulub crater” is too vague. Only soil samples from sites that are connected to the impact in some way are involved in either hypothesis.",

    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of artworks that were produced for exhibition on the internet. In this context, "defunct" means no longer existing or functioning. According to the text, many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible due to their reliance on certain software. As an example, the text cites Sinae Kim’s Genesis, which relied on software that was discontinued in 2021. This context supports the idea that the software is defunct. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that viewing artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet requires the use of software. Artists generally want their works to be seen by many people, so it wouldn’t make sense for creators of internet art to require the use of software that is "arcane," or known or knowable to only a few people. Moreover, the text states that a prominent example of software used to view these artworks is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it’s now defunct. Choice C is incorrect because "ubiquitous" would mean found everywhere, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text indicates that the reason why many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible has to do with the software required for viewing them. According to the text, one example of such software is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it’s now defunct. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the software used to view artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet is "extraneous," or irrelevant.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Kelmscott Press’s books. In this context, "manifest in" means evident or apparent from. The text states that the Kelmscott Press, which was cofounded by William Morris, produced its books using preindustrial methods. The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the creation of medieval manuscripts. This context suggests that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is apparent from, or manifest in, the methods and materials his company employed. Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is "insensible to," or unaware of or lacking perception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the production of the Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used to produce the Kelmscott editions are evidence of Morris’s repudiation of industrialization.

Although creating the Kelmscott editions may have involved examining the books closely, the text does not mention this aspect of Morris’s work, and in any case, the action of using certain materials to create those editions cannot scrutinize Morris’s attitude toward industrialization. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is "complicated by," or made more complex or dicult by, the Kelmscott Press’s use of preindustrial methods and handcrafted elements to produce books. Instead, the text presents those methods as exemplifying Morris’s repudiation of industrialization.',

    question:
      "Scholarly discussions of gender in Shakespeare’s comedies often celebrate the rebellion of the playwright’s characters against the rigid expectations ______ by Elizabethan society. Most of the comedies end in marriage, with characters returning to their socially dictated gender roles after previously defying them, but there are some notable exceptions. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. interjected",
    optionB: "B. committed",
    optionC: "C. illustrated",
    optionD: "D. prescribed",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of gender roles in Shakespeare’s comedies. As used in this context, “prescribed” would mean laid down as rules. The text indicates that the characters in the comedies often defy gender roles that are “socially dictated” (even if most characters do return to those roles eventually) and that scholars have been very interested in these acts of deance. This context indicates that what the characters are rebelling against are standards of behavior prescribed by the society of the time. Choice A is incorrect because saying that expectations about gender were “interjected,” or suddenly inserted between other things, wouldn’t make sense in context. There’s no suggestion in the text that the issue of gender roles was inserted between other things or was an interruption in a larger discussion. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been “socially dictated,” not expectations that society has “committed,” or carried out, entrusted, or promised. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been “socially dictated,” not expectations that have been “illustrated,” or claried with examples. Although it’s possible for expectations about gender roles to be illustrated, there’s nothing in the text to indicate that characters in Shakespeare’s comedies rebel against illustrations of gender expectations.",

    question:
      "Text 1 Philosopher G.E. Moore’s most inuential work entails the concept of common sense. He asserts that there are certain beliefs that all people, including philosophers, know instinctively to be true, whether or not they profess otherwise: among them, that they have bodies, or that they exist in a world with other objects that have three dimensions. Moore’s careful work on common sense may seem obvious but was in fact groundbreaking. Text 2 External world skepticism is a philosophical stance supposing that we cannot be sure of the existence of anything outside our own minds. During a lecture, G.E. Moore once offered a proof refuting this stance by holding out his hands and saying, “Here is one hand, and here is another.” Many philosophers reexively reject this proof (Annalisa Coliva called it “an obviously annoying failure”) but have found it a challenge to articulate exactly why the proof fails. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to proponents of the philosophical stance outlined in Text 2?",
    optionA:
      "A. By agreeing with those proponents that Moore’s treatment of positions that contradict his own is fundamentally unserious",
    optionB:
      "B. By suggesting that an instinctive distaste for Moore’s position is preventing external world skeptics from constructing a suciently rigorous refutation of Moore",
    optionC:
      "C. By arguing that if it is valid to assert that some facts are true based on instinct, it is also valid to assert that some proofs are inadequate based on instinct",
    optionD:
      "D. By pointing out that Moore would assert that external world skepticism is at odds with other beliefs those proponents must unavoidably hold",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. According to the author of Text 1, Moore’s denition of common sense—things we instinctively know are true—includes the belief that we all “exist in a world with other objects.” The author of Text 1 describes this notion as both “obvious” and “groundbreaking.” So it’s safe to infer that the author would observe that Moore would respond to external world skeptics by arguing that since everyone instinctively knows that things exist outside of their own minds, then external world skepticism must be wrong. Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to external world skeptics. If anything, the author of Text 1 seems to agree with Moore. Choice B is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to external world skeptics. The author of Text 1 never mentions external world skeptics directly, let alone why they have a hard time refuting Moore’s position. Choice C is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to external world skeptics. Text 1’s presentation of Moore’s concept of common sense only includes the idea that some facts are true based on instinct—it doesn’t mention the idea that some proofs are inadequate based on instinct.",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. borrows",
    optionB: "B. spans",
    optionC: "C. judges",
    optionD: "D. neglects",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Sueño de Familia art exhibition. In this context, “spans” means extends across or covers. The text states that the exhibition explores González’s artistic heritage and features artwork by her great-grandfather, grandmother, mother, and niece. This context conveys the idea that the exhibition spans, or extends across, ve generations of González’s family. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the exhibition “borrows,” or acquires, ve generations of González’s family. The text indicates that the exhibition features artwork by family members from ve generations, not that the ve generations themselves have been acquired for inclusion in the exhibition. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the purpose of the exhibition is to highlight artwork, not to “judge,” or give an opinion on, ve generations of the artist’s family. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the exhibition “neglects,” or gives little attention to, ve generations of González’s family. On the contrary, the text indicates that the exhibition is dedicated to exploring González’s artistic heritage and therefore designed to bring attention to her family members and their artwork.",

      "The following text is from Charlotte Forten Grimké’s 1888 poem “At Newport.” Oh, deep delight to watch the gladsome waves Exultant leap upon the rugged rocks; Ever repulsed, yet ever rushing on— Filled with a life that will not know defeat; To see the glorious hues of sky and sea. The distant snowy sails, glide spirit like, Into an unknown world, to feel the sweet Enchantment of the sea thrill all the soul, Clearing the clouded brain, making the heart Leap joyous as it own bright, singing waves! Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",
    optionA:
      "A. It portrays the surroundings as an imposing and intimidating scene.",
    optionB:
      "B. It characterizes the sea’s waves as a relentless and enduring force.",
    optionC: "C. It conveys the speaker’s ambivalence about the natural worl",
    optionD:
      "D. It draws a contrast between the sea’s waves and the speaker’s thoughts.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The text presents the speaker’s experience of viewing the sea. In the underlined portion, the speaker focuses on the idea that the waves hitting rocks on the shore are a relentless and enduring force: they are constantly pushed back (“ever repulsed”) but always return (“ever rushing on”), as though they have an energy that can’t be overcome (“a life that will not know defeat”). Choice A is incorrect. Although the underlined portion characterizes the waves as a relentless force (always “repulsed” but still “rushing on” and never being defeated), the speaker doesn’t suggest that the surroundings are intimidating. Instead, the speaker presents the scene in a positive way, describing the “deep delight” of the “gladsome,” or cheerful, waves and feeling “the heart / Leap joyous” while viewing the sea. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t suggest that the speaker is ambivalent, or has mixed feelings about, the natural world. Instead, it presents a single view of one part of the immediate surroundings: the speaker characterizes the sea’s waves as an unstoppable force, since they are constantly pushed back but always return (“ever repulsed, yet ever rushing on”). Choice D is incorrect. Although the text later suggests the speaker’s view of her own thoughts by referring to a “clouded brain” and a heart that leaps joyously, this reference neither occurs within the underlined portion nor establishes a clear contrast with the relentless determination of the waves. The underlined portion addresses only the speaker’s view of the waves and doesn’t suggest what her own thoughts might be.",

      "In 2008 a complete set of ancient pessoi (glass game pieces) was uncovered from beneath a paving stone in modern-day Israel. Due to their small size, pessoi were easily misplaced, making a whole set a rare nd. This has led some experts to suggest that the set may have been buried intentionally; however, without clear evidence, archaeologists are left to ______ what happened. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. speculate about",
    optionB: "B. dismiss",
    optionC: "C. expand on",
    optionD: "D. catalog",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. "Speculate" means "to form a theory or guess without any clear evidence." This makes sense because, due to the lack of "clear evidence," the archaeologists can only guess how the pessoi set might have come to be there. Choice B is incorrect. "Dismiss" can mean "send away" or "treat as unworthy of consideration." The text implies that the archaeologists are trying to gure out the truth—they wouldn’t "dismiss" what really happened. Choice C is incorrect. "Expand on" means "give more details about," but there aren’t any details to give. Without any "clear evidence," the archaeologists can’t give any more details. Choice D is incorrect. "Catalog" means "carefully record" or "make a list of." However, there’s no "clear evidence," so there’s no real information to "catalog."',

      "Text 1 Like the work of Ralph Ellison before her, Toni Morrison’s novels feature scenes in which characters deliver sermons of such length and verbal dexterity that for a time, the text exchanges the formal parameters of ction for those of oral literature. Given the many other echoes of Ellison in Morrison’s novels, both in structure and prose style, these scenes suggest Ellison’s direct inuence on Morrison. Text 2 In their destabilizing effect on literary form, the sermons in Morrison’s works recall those in Ellison’s. Yet literature by Black Americans abounds in moments where interpolated speech erodes the division between oral and written forms that literature in English has traditionally observed. Morrison’s use of the sermon is attributable not only to the inuence of Ellison but also to a community-wide strategy of resistance to externally imposed literary conventions. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize the underlined claim in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. As failing to consider Ellison’s and Morrison’s equivalent uses of the sermon within the wider cultural context in which they wrote",
    optionB:
      "B. As misunderstanding the function of sermons in novels by Black American writers other than Ellison and Morrison",
    optionC:
      "C. As disregarding points of structural and stylistic divergence between the works of Ellison and those of Morrison",
    optionD:
      "D. As being indebted to the tradition of resisting literary conventions that privilege written forms, such as novels, over sermons and other oral forms",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. The author of Text 2 argues that Morrison’s use of the sermon is not only inuenced by Ellison, but also by a “community-wide strategy of resistance” to literary conventions practiced by Black American authors. Ellison, Text 2 alleges, is only one of many inuences on Morrison. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text specically mentions sermons in works by authors other than Morrison or Ellison, only a tendency towards eroding “the division between oral and written forms” among Black American writers. Choice C is incorrect. Both texts describe similarities between the works of Ellison and Morrison, and neither points out instances of divergence. Text 2 simply suggests that Morrison was inuenced by more than just Ellison. Choice D is incorrect. While Text 2 does discuss Morrison’s resistance to certain literary conventions, it’s unclear what it would mean for the underlined claim to be “indebted” to that tradition.

      "US trac signals didn’t always contain the familiar three lights (red, yellow, and green). Trac lights only ______ red and green lights until the three-light trac signal was developed in the 1920s. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. avoided",
    optionB: "B. featured",
    optionC: "C. appreciated",
    optionD: "D. disregarded",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of trac signals. As used in this context, “featured” means had as a characteristic or part. The text indicates that although US trac signals have lights of three different colors (red, yellow, and green), this wasn’t the case until the 1920s, when the three-light signal was rst developed. Before then, the text suggests, trac signals had fewer lights (as indicated by the word “only” in the second sentence). This context supports the idea that before the 1920s, trac signals featured only red and green lights. Choice A is incorrect because “avoided” means kept away from someone or something or prevented something from occurring, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn’t discuss keeping away from someone or something but instead focuses on what US trac signals look like. The text states that they didn’t have lights of three different colors until the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Choice C is incorrect because “appreciated” means admired or increased in value, neither of which would make sense in context. The text focuses solely on the fact that US trac signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. The text doesn’t mention how this characteristic or trac signals in general are perceived or what their value is. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes “trac signals,” which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to admire or increase the value of something. Choice D is incorrect because “disregarded” means ignored or treated something as unworthy of notice, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn’t discuss how people react to trac signals; rather, it addresses the idea that US trac signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes “trac signals,” which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to ignore or treat something in a particular manner.",

He had a thorough knowledge of the neighborhood, was familiar with the roads and the watercourses, knew the qualities of the various soils and what they would produce, and where the best hunting and shing were to be had. He was a marvelous hand in the management of horses and dogs. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:

    optionB: "B. To give an example of Julius’s knowledge about soil",
    optionC:
      "C. To show that the narrator and Julius often hunt and sh together",
    optionD: "D. To explain different ways in which Julius was helpful",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain different ways in which Julius was helpful. The text begins with the narrator stating that Julius was very helpful to him and his wife when they moved to their new residence. The narrator then provides a list of examples to illustrate Julius’s helpfulness. For instance, the narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood’s roads, which suggests that he was helpful in navigating them, and that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs. The text’s many examples of Julius’s usefulness reinforce just how helpful he was and in how many different ways. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray either the narrator’s or his wife’s reaction to their new home. Rather, the text focuses on how Julius was useful to the narrator and his wife in their new home. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Julius was knowledgeable about the soil, this is one of several supporting details that illustrate how helpful Julius was. Moreover, the text merely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn’t provide an example of that knowledge. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest the frequency with which the narrator and Julius hunted and shed together. In fact, it’s unclear from the text whether the narrator and Julius hunted and shed together at all.

    question:
      "Text 1 Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel Orlando is an oddity within her body of work. Her other major novels consist mainly of scenes of everyday life and describe their characters’ interior states in great detail, whereas Orlando propels itself through a series of fantastical events and considers its characters’ psychology more supercially. Woolf herself sometimes regarded the novel as a minor work, even admitting once that she “began it as a joke.” Text 2 Like Woolf’s other great novels, Orlando portrays how people’s memories inform their experience of the present. Like those works, it examines how people navigate social interactions shaped by gender and social class. Though it is lighter in tone—more entertaining, even—this literary “joke” nonetheless engages seriously with the themes that motivated the four or ve other novels by Woolf that have achieved the status of literary classics. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assessment of Orlando presented in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By conceding that Woolf’s talents were best suited to serious novels but asserting that the humor in Orlando is often effective",
    optionB:
      "B. By agreeing that Orlando is less impressive than certain other novels by Woolf but arguing that it should still be regarded as a classic",
    optionC:
      "C. By acknowledging that Orlando clearly differs from Woolf’s other major novels but insisting on its centrality to her body of work nonetheless",
    optionD:
      "D. By concurring that the reputation of Orlando as a minor work has led readers to overlook this novel but maintaining that the reputation is unearned",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the assessment of Orlando in Text 1. Both authors agree that Orlando is unusual for Woolf: Text 1 states that the novel examines its characters’ psychologies more supercially than Woolf’s other novels do, and Text 2 describes it as being lighter in tone. However, while Text 1 calls Orlando an “oddity” and mentions that Woolf “began it as a joke,” Text 2 asserts that Orlando engages the same themes as Woolf’s other great novels. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely accept that Orlando differs from Woolf’s other novels but would also insist on its importance in the context of Woolf’s work as a writer. Choice A is incorrect. Text 2 does suggest that the humor in Orlando is effective. However, there’s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author would agree that Woolf’s talents were best suited to serious novels. Rather, the author of Text 2 compares Orlando favorably to other novels by Woolf that are implied to be darker in tone. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 does not indicate that Orlando is less impressive than Woolf’s other novels, but instead points out that it engages the same themes as other novels by Woolf that are considered classics.

    optionB: "B. a straightforward",
    optionC: "C. an inconclusive",
    optionD: "D. an unbiased",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s description of efforts to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems. As used in this context, describing an explanation as “a straightforward” one would mean that the explanation is direct and uncomplicated. The text asserts that since it should be “nearly impossible” for planets to form in binary star systems, it’s “not surprising” that there isn’t a straightforward explanation for the existence of planets in such systems; the fact that one potential approach involves “complex” factors offers further contextual support for this idea. Choice A is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that there isn’t “a discernible” explanation—meaning an explanation capable of being perceived—for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text discusses just such an explanation offered by Roman Rakov and Kedron Silsbee, which indicates that their explanation can be discerned. Choice C is incorrect because the text emphasizes how dicult it is to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems, suggesting that the situation isn’t marked by the lack of “an inconclusive” explanation—an explanation that does not resolve the issue—but rather that if any explanations have been offered, they’ve likely been inconclusive ones. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a lack of “an unbiased,” or impartial and unprejudiced, explanation for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text indicates that it’s dicult to explain the existence of planets in such systems and it describes one attempt to do so, but there is no evidence that explanations from Roman Rakov and Kedron Silsbee or others are biased.",

    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of US forest land classications. In this context, "consensus" means agreement. The text indicates that a percentage given in a US forest land report differs from other estimates and that this discrepancy isn’t surprising, given that forest researchers regularly dispute one another’s classications of parts of US forest land as either mature or old growth. This context conveys that there is little agreement when it comes to these categories. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classications of US forest land as either mature or old growth, which directly indicates that when it comes to these categories, there is much "deliberation," or discussion and consideration, not little deliberation. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classications of US forest land as either mature or old growth; this doesn’t imply that there is little "vigilance," or careful attention, among researchers when it comes to these categories but rather conveys that researchers do pay attention to forest land classications and question one another’s decisions.

      "Text 1 Most animals can regenerate some parts of their bodies, such as skin. But when a three-banded panther worm is cut into three pieces, each piece grows into a new worm. Researchers are investigating this feat partly to learn more about humans’ comparatively limited abilities to regenerate, and they’re making exciting progress. An especially promising discovery is that both humans and panther worms have a gene for early growth response (EGR) linked to regeneration. Text 2 When Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR, it caused excitement. However, as the team pointed out, the gene likely functions very differently in humans than it does in panther worms. Srivastava has likened EGR to a switch that activates other genes involved in regeneration in panther worms, but how this switch operates in humans remains unclear. Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 2 most likely say about Text 1’s characterization of the discovery involving EGR?",
    optionA:
      "A. It is reasonable given that Srivastava and her team have identied how EGR functions in both humans and panther worms.",
    optionB:

    optionC:
      "C. It is unexpected given that Srivastava and her team’s ndings were generally met with enthusiasm.",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Text 1 based on the information provided. Text 1 discusses the discovery of a regeneration-linked gene, EGR, in both three-banded panther worms (which are capable of full regeneration) and humans (who have relatively limited regeneration abilities). Text 1 characterizes this discovery as “especially promising” and a sign of “exciting progress” in understanding human regeneration. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR nding pointed out that while EGR’s function in humans isn’t yet known, it’s likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1’s enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava’s team’s observations about EGR in humans. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven’t yet identied how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn’t say that Text 1’s excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1’s excitement as premature and overly optimistic. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 does treat Srivastava’s team’s ndings with enthusiasm; it describes the discovery of EGR in both three-banded panther worms and humans as promising and exciting. It would be illogical for the author of Text 2 to say that because most others treat the discovery with enthusiasm, Text 1’s enthusiastic characterization of the discovery is unexpected. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 isn’t at all dismissive of Srivastava’s team’s ndings; instead, Text 1 is optimistic about the EGR discovery, characterizing it as promising and exciting. There’s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author of Text 2 would say that Text 1’s praise for the discovery is dismissive, or disdainful.",

    question:
      "Several studies have found negligible electoral consequences for governments that impose scal austerity measures, yet some European governments recently suffered electorally due to their austerity programs. Evelyne Huebscher and colleagues attribute this incongruity to governments’ tendency—not followed in the recent European cases—to implement austerity programs strategically to avoid electoral costs (e.g., setting spending cuts to take effect only after the next election), which has obscured the inherent political risks of austerity measures in the election data scholars have examined. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?",
    optionA: "A. ",
    optionB:
      "B. It identies a conict between research ndings and recent events that the text goes on to suggest is a consequence of a complicating factor in the data used\nto generate those ndings.",
    optionC:
      "C. It presents a long-standing divergence in research ndings that the text goes on to say is due to different groups of researchers using data that derive from\ndifferent electoral circumstances.",
    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The underlined sentence explains that contrary to what several studies would suggest, recent European governments suffered electorally after the launch of scal austerity programs. The text goes on to indicate that the researchers generated their ndings from data that didn’t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures because the data were based on cases in which governments had set austerity programs to take effect after the next election, a practice the European governments that recently suffered electorally didn’t adhere to, thus introducing a complicating factor resulting in a conict between the research ndings and recent events. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t indicate that the discrepancy described in the text is between observations made in study settings and observations made in real-world settings. Rather, the underlined sentence indicates that the outcome of recent events is contrary to what would be expected based on the ndings of several studies. Additionally, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the studies mentioned did not use real-world data; instead, the text indicates that the data used was generated under potentially different circumstances than the recent events. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t present a long-standing divergence in research ndings but rather a discrepancy between past research ndings and recent events that the text goes on to attribute to researchers’ use of data that didn’t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures. Choice D is incorrect because while the underlined sentence notes that there have been some recent exceptions to a general pattern observed in several research studies, it does not go on to attribute this exception to the researchers underestimating inconsistencies in the data. Rather, the text goes on to attribute this to a circumstance (scal austerity measures being implemented before an election rather than after) which adds a complicating factor into the data not accounted for in past studies.",

      "In the late 1800s, Spanish-language newspapers ourished in cities across Texas. San Antonio alone produced eleven newspapers in Spanish between 1890 and 1900. But El Paso surpassed all other cities in the state. This city produced twenty-two newspapers in Spanish during that period. El Paso is located on the border with Mexico and has always had a large population of Spanish speakers. Thus, it is unsurprising that this city became such a rich site for Spanish-language journalism. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To compare Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas today with ones published there during the late 1800s",

    optionD:
      "D. To explain why Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas were so popular in Mexico during the late 1800s",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by stating that there were many Spanish-language newspapers in cities across Texas in the late 1800s, citing San Antonio as a city that produced eleven such newspapers. The text then goes on to note that in El Paso, there were twenty-two newspapers published in Spanish in the late 1800s, more than any other Texas city. The text then concludes by explaining that the reason for this large number of Spanish-language newspapers was likely El Paso’s location near Mexico and its large population of Spanish speakers. Therefore, the main purpose of the text is to explain that Spanish-language newspapers thrived in Texas cities, especially in El Paso, in the late 1800s. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas today, let alone compare them with newspapers that were published in the 1800s. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes El Paso as a particularly rich site for Spanish-language journalism in the late 1800s, the text doesn’t discuss whether newspapers published in El Paso inuenced the newspapers published in other cities across Texas, including San Antonio.

    question:
      "Text 1 Because literacy in Nahuatl script, the writing system of the Aztec Empire, was lost after Spain invaded central Mexico in the 1500s, it is unclear exactly how meaning was encoded in the script’s symbols. Although many scholars had assumed that the symbols signied entire words, linguist Alfonso Lacadena theorized in 2008 that they signied units of language smaller than words: individual syllables. Text 2 The growing consensus among scholars of Nahuatl script is that many of its symbols could signify either words or syllables, depending on syntax and content at any given site within a text. For example, the symbol signifying the word huipil (blouse) in some contexts could signify the syllable “pil” in others, as in the place name “Chipiltepec.” Thus, for the Aztecs, reading required a determination of how such symbols functioned each time they appeared in a text. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize Lacadena’s theory, as described in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By praising the theory for recognizing that the script’s symbols could represent entire words",
    optionB:
      "B. By arguing that the theory is overly inuenced by the work of earlier scholars",
    optionC:
      "C. By approving of the theory’s emphasis on how the script changed over time",
    optionD:
      "D. By cautioning that the theory overlooks certain important aspects of how the script functioned",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. Lacadena’s theory is that Nahuatl script symbols signied syllables, but the consensus described in Text 2 is that they can signify either symbols or full words, depending on the context. So the author of Text 2 would likely consider Lacadena’s theory too simplistic: it’s missing the importance of the context in determining the meaning of a symbol. Choice A is incorrect. This conicts with Text 1’s description of Lacadena’s theory. Lacadena’s theory is that Nahuatl script symbols signied syllables. Choice B is incorrect. This conicts with Text 1’s description of Lacadena’s theory. Text 1 states that Lacadena’s theory differed from what earlier scholars believed. Choice C is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how the author of Text 2 would characterize Lacadena’s theory. Neither text mentions how or even if the script changed over time.",

One anthropologist set out to test this hypothesis. Using a mechanical spear-thrower, he launched spears with Clovis points into mounds of clay— substitutes for the animals’ large bodies. The projectiles generally penetrated only a few inches into the clay, an amount insucient to have harmed most woolly mammoths. This led the anthropologist to conclude that hunters using spears with Clovis points likely weren’t the principal drivers of the extinction. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text, which is to describe an experiment whose results cast doubt on an established hypothesis. The text begins by noting that researchers have long believed that woolly mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with Clovis points. The text then describes an experiment conducted by an anthropologist to test this hypothesis.

Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that researchers have been involved in an ongoing debate. On the contrary, the text suggests that most researchers agree on the cause of the woolly mammoth’s extinction in North America. Choice B is incorrect because the text never mentions any advantages or disadvantages of the method used in the experiment, focusing instead on the results achieved using that method.

And as Jane X. Luu et al. point out, the singular nature of impact ejection makes it untenable as an account of multiple loss episodes of similar duration over several years. Instead, Luu et al. are likely correct that 6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. It presents a scientic observation, describes a contrast between that observation and other observations, and then explains why those other observations\nshould not be considered credible.",

    optionD: "D. ",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by introducing the natural phenomenon of intermittent mass loss with regard to Asteroid 6478 Gault and notes that it curiously has not lost mass at its perihelion like other asteroids typically do. The text then refutes "solar energy–driven ice vaporization" and "the singular nature of impact ejection" as two possible explanations for Asteroid 6478 Gault’s intermittent mass loss. Finally, the text presents Luu et al.’s explanation that "6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability," which the author says is "likely correct." Thus, the overall structure of the text is that it introduces a natural phenomenon, refutes two potential explanations for that phenomenon, and then presents a third explanation for that phenomenon that the author regards as plausible. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t distinguish between multiple observations. It focuses on the single observation that Asteroid 6478 Gault is losing mass and evaluates multiple explanations for the phenomenon. The text also asserts that Luu et al.’s explanation is credible and "likely correct." Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a natural phenomenon, not a specic astronomical nding. In addition, although the text does note awed reasons for Asteroid 6478 Gault’s intermittent mass loss, it doesn’t mention that Asteroid 6478 Gault’s intermittent mass loss is based on new evidence. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does evaluate explanations for the cause of Asteroid 6478 Gault’s intermittent mass loss, the text also asserts that Luu et al.’s explanation that they have put forth is persuasive and "likely correct."',

      'Choice C is the best answer. An "anomaly" is something that deviates from norms or expectations. In this case, the elkhorn coral is an anomaly because it can pass on somatic mutations, whereas most other animals can’t. Choice A is incorrect. A "hypothesis" is "a theory about something," but no theories are provided about elkhorn coral in this text, just facts. Choice B is incorrect. "Anity" represents "an inclination or liking toward something." As genetic mutations tend to occur without any conscious effort, you can’t really have an inclination toward passing on somatic mutations. Choice D is incorrect. "Corroboration" means "evidence to support or prove something."

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about Kouchaki and colleagues’ research into how workload affects productivity. In context, “ecient” means effective or well organized. The text indicates that, according to Kouchaki and colleagues’ research, people who worked on hard tasks rst were “more skilled and productive” than those who did easy tasks rst. This context conveys the idea that despite their sense of accomplishment, the people who chose to do the easy tasks rst were less ecient or productive than those who tackled hard tasks rst.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion about genes related to hibernation. In this context, “dormant” means inactive.

In other words, these genes don’t function in humans. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “decisive” means has the power to affect the outcome of something, but the text states that genes related to hibernation are instead inactive in humans—that is, the genes don’t affect humans’ bodily processes, although they are present in their bodies. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “lacking” means missing, but the text states that the genes are present in humans, though inactive.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Arturo A. Schomburg’s collection. In this context, the phrase “depended on” means relied on. The text explains that Schomburg, wanting to preserve “books, art, and other materials” created by peoples of African descent from around the world, built a large collection of these objects. The text also states that in order to obtain these items, Schomburg asked friends and colleagues who were traveling internationally to bring them back for him. This implies that he wouldn’t have been able to create his collection without help. Thus, the context supports the idea that Schomburg relied on, or depended on, friends and colleagues to build his collection. Choice A is incorrect because “admired” means respected and approved of. Although it’s reasonable to expect that Schomburg respected his friends and colleagues, the text doesn’t discuss any such aspect of their relationships. The text focuses instead on what Schomburg asked his friends and colleagues to do to help build his collection. Choice B is incorrect because “disagreed with” means held an opposing belief, and nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg and his friends or colleagues held opposing views on any subject. In fact, the text strongly implies that Schomburg’s friends and colleagues supported him in his goal of preserving objects of importance for Black history and culture by bringing him such objects from around the world.

Text 2 Economists Dario Focarelli and Fabio Panetta have argued that research on the effect of mergers on prices has focused excessively on short-term effects, which tend to be adverse for consumers. Using the case of consumer banking in Italy, they show that over the long term (several years, in their study), the eciency gains realized by merged companies do result in economic benets for consumers.

      "D. They would claim that mergers have a different effect on consumer prices in the newspaper industry than in most other industries.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because, based on the information presented in the texts, it represents how Focarelli and Panetta would most likely respond to Fan’s ndings. Text 1 indicates that Fan found that a newspaper merger would result in a rise in subscription prices. This rise wouldn’t benet customers, who would have to pay more for news after a merger. Text 2 presents Focarelli and Panetta’s argument that merger research tends to focus too much on what happens immediately after the merger. Text 2 goes on to describe their nding that mergers can be economically benecial for consumers over the long term. This suggests that Focarelli and Panetta would encourage Fan to investigate the long-term effect of the hypothetical newspaper merger on subscription prices. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t indicate that Focarelli and Panetta connect the effects of mergers to specic locations. Instead, Focarelli and Panetta focus on the length of time over which the effects of mergers should be evaluated. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that Focarelli and Panetta found that merged companies experience "eciency gains" over the long term, meaning that their expenses go down relative to their output, not that their expenses increase. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no indication in Text 2 that Focarelli and Panetta believe that the newspaper industry is different from any other industry when it comes to the effects of mergers. Although their own research was about consumer banking, Text 2 suggests that they view their conclusions as applicable to mergers in general.',

      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The rst sentence explains that Bernabei and his team studied growth rings to obtain information about the ancient oak planks found during a construction project in Rome. The next sentence presents what the researchers learned: the wood from the planks came from France’s Jura region, which is far from Rome. The underlined sentence then presents the implications of the ndings about the planks: the wood must have been brought to Rome by boat, a dicult task that suggests Roman trade routes were complex. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to present a conclusion about Roman trade routes based on the team’s ndings. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the team thought the ancient planks were used in the construction of a boat, nor does the underlined sentence question that conclusion.

It is best, however, to understand Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist chronologically. Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, with each one representing a particular thematic and stylistic cohesion: the 1960s, the two decades between 1970 and 1990, and lastly, from roughly 1990 onwards. Text 2 It is tempting to impose a linear sense of order on the expanse of Wole Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist. However, critics who have considered Soyinka’s plays to t neatly into three phases overlook potential commonalities in Soyinka’s work that span across these phases. Additionally, this view may discount signicant differences in the styles and content of plays written around the same time.

    question:
      "Jackie Ormes’s Torchy Brown in Dixie to Harlem (1937–38) was the rst comic strip by a Black woman to appear in a widely read newspaper. The strip tells the story of Torchy, a young woman who leaves Mississippi to become a performer in New York City. Torchy’s story reects the experience of the Great Migration (1910–1970), when millions of Black Americans left the South in search of opportunities in other parts of the United States. Torchy Brown thus shows how Ormes used comics to comment humorously on issues affecting Black Americans, which she continued to do throughout her career. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To show how Ormes’s Torchy Brown inspired other Black women to write comic strips in the 1930s",
    optionB:
      "B. To illustrate how the subjects Ormes addressed in her comic strips changed over the course of her career",

      "The early British postal system required the cost of mail delivery to be paid upon receipt, a system which encouraged inventive strategies by the intended recipient to avoid payment. To improve this system, ______ were proposed in 1837, including the use of a postage stamp, a small receipt pasted to the mail indicating that delivery costs had been paid by the sender. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. investigations",
    optionB: "B. expansions",
    optionC: "C. reforms",
    optionD: "D. possessions",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the early British postal system. In this context, "reforms" most nearly means attempts at improving something. The text indicates that the pay-upon-delivery postage method led to fee avoidance on the part of recipients. It then says that action was taken to improve the postal system, giving examples such as the move to having the sender pay and axing stamps to indicate payment had been received. These represent revisions to the system intended to improve its functioning; therefore, "reforms" most logically completes the text. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "investigations" most nearly means attempts to understand something. And although it is plausible that an attempt to improve the postal system would involve investigations, nothing in the text provides a logical basis for understanding the example of changes like axing stamps to letters as an investigation. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, "expansions" most nearly means additions to something. Although the text indicates that some new policies were adopted, nothing in the text suggests that the overall number of policies increased, which expansions would seem to entail. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, "possessions" most nearly means items of personal property or things that otherwise belong to, or are part of, something. The text provides no logical context for understanding changes like axing stamps to letters as possessions.',

    optionB: "B. remember",
    optionC: "C. foster",
    optionD: "D. discourage",
    correctAnswer: 2,

      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jung and her team’s study of acts of kindness. In this context, “foster” means encourage or promote the development of. The text indicates that Jung and her team found that seeing a helpful (or prosocial) act makes a bystander more likely to help someone else, which can in turn inspire additional people to help others. That is, the team showed that single acts of kindness can foster additional prosocial acts across a group. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Jung and her team found that single acts of kindness “require,” or depend on or make obligatory, broader prosocial (or helpful) behavior across a group. There’s no suggestion in the text that individual acts of kindness can only occur if other prosocial acts have already occurred, and the text indicates only that an act of kindness can inspire additional helpful acts, not that it necessarily will do so. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on a possible direct effect of individual acts of kindness, or single helpful actions, and it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that actions can “remember,” or hold a memory of, something. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Jung and her team found that single acts of kindness can “discourage,” or hinder, prosocial (or helpful) behavior across a group.

      "The following text is adapted from Jane Austen’s 1814 novel Manseld Park. The speaker, Tom, is considering staging a play at home with a group of his friends and family. We mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our powers in something new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may be trusted, I think, in choosing some play most perfectly unexceptionable; and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To offer Tom’s assurance that the play will be inoffensive and involve only a small number of people",

    optionD:
      "D. To assert that Tom believes the group performing the play will be able to successfully promote it",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately portrays the main purpose of the text. At the beginning of the text, Tom asserts that he and the other people staging the play are doing so only for “a little amusement among ourselves” and aren’t interested in attracting an audience or any attention with the production. Then, Tom promises that the play they chose is modest and appropriate, and he further reasons that using the well-written prose of “some respectable author” is better than using their own words. Overall, the main purpose of the text is to convey Tom’s promise that the play will be inoffensive and involve only a few people. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Tom had earlier intentions for the play’s performance or that anything has changed since the group rst decided to stage a play. Instead, the text focuses on how harmless the entire endeavor will be. Choice C is incorrect. Although Tom mentions that using the words of a “respectable author” will be better than using their own words, he never addresses the idea that the people around him generally aren’t skilled enough to stage a play. Choice D is incorrect because in the text Tom specically says that they “want no audience, no publicity,” which indicates that they don’t plan on promoting the play at all.",

    optionB: "B. intriguing",
    optionC: "C. signicant",
    optionD: "D. useful",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about handedness in animals. As used in this context, “recognizable” means apparent or identiable. The text indicates that handedness is “easy to observe in humans,” but that animal-behavior researchers use special tasks to determine handedness in other animals. This context and the use of “less” before the blank indicate that compared with handedness in humans, handedness in other animals is less recognizable. Choice B is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less “intriguing,” or fascinating, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn’t suggest that handedness is more fascinating in humans. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less “signicant,” or important or meaningful, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn’t suggest that handedness is more signicant in humans. Choice D is incorrect because “useful,” or functional or helpful, wouldn’t make sense in context.

The narrator says that "there ain’t nothing funnier" than watching people try to work out on the stair climber machine. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to describe an activity that the narrator nds amusing. Choice A is incorrect because the text isn’t about the narrator beginning middle school.

    optionB: "B. observant",
    optionC: "C. critical",
    optionD: "D. condent",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jacob Lawrence’s artistic process. In this context, “observant” means watchful and perceptive. The text emphasizes that the “close attention” Lawrence paid to “all the details” of his neighborhood allowed him to reect subtle elements of “the beauty and vitality of the Black experience” in his artwork. This context indicates that being observant of his surroundings was an important part of Lawrence’s work as an artist. Choice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was “skeptical,” or had an attitude of doubt in general or about particular things, let alone that skepticism was important to him as an artist. Rather than indicating that he was skeptical, the text focuses on how Lawrence paid careful attention to everything around him and reected his observations in his artwork. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was “critical,” which in this context would mean inclined to criticize harshly or unfairly. Rather than indicating that Lawrence found fault in things, the text suggests that he paid careful attention to everything around him and that his artwork reects this careful attention. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Lawrence was “condent,” or self-assured. Rather than addressing how Lawrence felt about himself and how that feeling affected his artistic process, the text emphasizes the careful attention Lawrence paid to everything around him—attention that allowed him to capture subtle elements of a particular place and time in his artwork.",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. involuntarily",
    optionB: "B. benecially",
    optionC: "C. strenuously",
    optionD: "D. smoothly",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of diaphragm contractions and hiccups. In this context, “involuntarily” means done without any control, or by reex. The text explains that when a person’s diaphragm repeatedly contracts and results in hiccups (which may be benecial for infants), those muscle contractions are “uncontrollable.” This context indicates that the diaphragm contractions occur without the person’s control. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t support the logical relationship established in the text’s discussion of diaphragm contractions and hiccups. The text indicates that although specic causes for hiccups haven’t been identied, it may be the case that the muscle contractions that occur have an important purpose in infants. It wouldn’t make sense to say that even though the contractions occur “benecially,” or with a good or helpful effect, they might play a positive role in infants’ breathing regulation. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups are “uncontrollable.” Because those muscle contractions are described as happening automatically and without the person’s control, it wouldn’t make sense to describe them as occurring “strenuously,” or in a way that requires great effort or energy. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the quality of the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups beyond stating that they are “uncontrollable.” Nothing in the text indicates that those muscle contractions occur “smoothly,” or evenly and continuously.",

Geologist Melisa Diaz and her team studied dust in Antarctica to nd out if it was moved by aeolian transport. They discovered that the dust matched geological material in Australia. Aeolian transport had carried it from one continent to another, across thousands of miles of open ocean. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",

    optionD:
      "D. It explains the difference between two kinds of geological material.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The rst two sentences introduce the idea that soil and rocks can be moved from one location to another by something other than rivers and streams. The underlined sentence then states that the term used by scientists to refer to this process is “aeolian transport.” The discussion that follows explains what aeolian transport is (the movement of small geological materials over potentially great distances by the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust particles had been moved by aeolian transport from Australia to Antarctica. Thus, the underlined portion introduces a scientic term that is used in the discussion that follows. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text doesn’t present any remarks from Melisa Diaz, nor does it suggest that Diaz and her team encountered diculties in their study. Instead, the phrase in quotation marks in the underlined portion simply presents a term that is used by scientists to refer to a specic process discussed in the text. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in either the underlined portion or the text as a whole suggests that the ndings of the study presented in the text were surprising or unexpected. In fact, the text suggests that Diaz and her team wanted to see if aeolian transport could explain the appearance of certain geological materials in Antarctica, and their ndings did indeed conrm the involvement of aeolian transport. Choice D is incorrect. Although the rst sentence of the text mentions soil and rocks, which are two different kinds of geological material, the underlined portion doesn’t refer to these materials, nor does it explain the difference between them.

    optionB: "B. sensitive",
    optionC: "C. limited",
    optionD: "D. receptive",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of wild rice. As used in this context, "sensitive" means vulnerable or easily affected. The text indicates that climate change is causing the lakes to get deeper, which consequently threatens the wild rice that grows in the area. The text goes on to state that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to uproot from the bottom of the lake. This context supports the idea that the plants are sensitive to water depth during early stages of development. Choice A is incorrect because "immune" means protected or shielded, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text explains that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to become uprooted and destroyed, indicating that these plants are harmed by deep water, not protected from it. Choice C is incorrect because "limited" means conned or restrained, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text explains that water depth can negatively affect young wild-rice plants but doesn’t suggest that water depth limits or restrains the plants. Choice D is incorrect because "receptive" means open or tolerant, which wouldn’t make sense in this context.

    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the origins of the unique dialect of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico. In this context, "traced" means tracked back to. The text notes that the regional variety of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has its roots in the language of the Taínos and in the West African language of Yoruba. This context supports the idea that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced back to Yoruba. Choice B is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be "surrendered," or handed over on demand, to the pronunciation in Yoruba. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish has been "announced," or ocially declared or proclaimed. According to the text, elements of the dialect have been inherited or borrowed from African languages, and the relationship between the pronunciation of certain vowels in the Puerto Rican dialect and in Yoruba is an example of this inheritance, suggesting that the pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced to Yoruba. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect.

      'Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The text begins by mentioning scholarly accounts of the Chicano movement, which the underlined portion describes as tending "to focus on the most militant, outspoken gures in the movement," making the movement as a whole seem uniformly radical. The text then indicates that the work of geographer Juan Herrera shows that focusing less on such militant gures and instead paying more attention to manifestations of the Chicano movement in less widely known neighborhood institutions and projects would reveal that the movement’s participants embraced a range of political orientations and approaches. Thus, the underlined portion describes a common approach to studying the Chicano movement that, according to the text, obscures the ideological diversity of the movement’s participants. Choice A is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does present a trend in scholarship on the Chicano movement, the text does not indicate that other scholars have reevaluated their methods in light of Herrera’s work. It only indicates that Herrera’s work suggests that the work of those other scholars does not provide a complete picture of the Chicano movement. Choice B is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does identify an aspect of the Chicano movement that the text indicates has been overemphasized, the text does not discuss the political orientations of the scholars whose work is mentioned in the text. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does summarize the conventional method for analyzing the Chicano movement, the rest of the text does not address the effectiveness of "comparatively low-prole neighborhood institutions and projects." Instead, the text suggests that those projects were led by people with a variety of approaches to community activism.',

    question:
      "Some people have speculated that two helmets with attached horns discovered in Denmark in 1942 belonged to Vikings, but scholars have long been skeptical. Archaeologist Helle Vandkilde and colleagues recently provided radiocarbon dates for the helmets, and their ndings ______ scholars’ skepticism: the helmets date to the Nordic Bronze Age, centuries before the Vikings existed. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. anticipate",
    optionB: "B. inspect",
    optionC: "C. reveal",
    optionD: "D. justify",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the helmets found in Denmark. In this context, “justify” means conrm or give reasons for. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical about the supposed Viking origin of two helmets found in Denmark. The radiocarbon dating of the helmets conducted by Vandkilde and colleagues demonstrates that the helmets date from the Nordic Bronze Age, making the helmets too old to have belonged to Vikings. This context supports the idea that the scholars’ skepticism is justied. Choice A is incorrect because “anticipate” means expect or come before, neither of which would make sense in context. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical of the idea that the helmets belonged to Vikings. Because the skepticism has existed for a long time, Vandkilde and colleagues’ research couldn’t be said to anticipate it. Instead, the radiocarbon dating results justify or conrm the scholar’s skepticism. Choice B is incorrect because “inspect” means examine or review, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. Research ndings are inanimate and therefore unable to inspect scholars’ skepticism. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues found that the helmets are from the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers’ ndings justify, not inspect, the scholars’ skepticism. Choice C is incorrect because “reveal” means uncover or report, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues tested the helmets and found that they date to the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore are much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers’ ndings conrm or justify the scholars’ skepticism, which was already known so didn’t need to be revealed.",

    question:
      "The following text is adapted from Zora Neale Hurston’s 1921 short story “John Redding Goes to Sea.” John wants to travel far beyond the village where he lives near his mother, Matty. [John] had on several occasions attempted to reconcile his mother to the notion, but found it a dicult task. Matty always took refuge in self-pity and tears. Her son’s desires were incomprehensible to her, that was all. As used in the text, what does the phrase “reconcile his mother to” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Get his mother to accept",
    optionB: "B. Get his mother to apologize for",
    optionC: "C. Get his mother to match",
    optionD: "D. Get his mother to reunite with",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. The expression “reconcile to” means “to cause (a person) to accept something dicult or disagreeable.” The text suggests that John wants his mother to accept his desire to travel, even though she doesn’t like that idea. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t make sense. John doesn’t want his mother to apologize for his own desire to travel—he wants her to accept his desire to travel. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t suggest that John wants his mother to match his desire to travel. Rather, he wants her to accept his desire to travel even though she doesn’t like it. Choice D is incorrect. This is tempting, because it seems to pick up on the idea of people “reconciling” after a ght, but it actually doesn’t make sense. The text never suggests that John’s mother was “united with” the idea of him traveling in the past—if anything, it seems like she’s always been against it. Besides, it would be strange to say that a person “reunites with” a notion.",

It then discusses the ndings of the study, including the fact that all the seeds germinated but that the plants grown in lunar soil exhibited signs of stress. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t address this question, and never describes any specic characteristics of either soil.

My soul had left its body to lose itself in the wild unrestrained beauty around me—from where it came—and only left a trembling suggestion of its existence within me. The other passengers moved around me like shadows, and again and again my eyes drank in all the glory and wealth of that night. As used in the text, what does the word “suggestion” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Trace",
    optionB: "B. Opinion",
    optionC: "C. Dispute",
    optionD: "D. Command",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “suggestion” most nearly means trace. The text portrays the narrator standing on the deck of a boat, admiring the view of nature afforded by this position: “My soul had left its body to lose itself in the wild unrestrained beauty around me,” says the narrator, “and only left a trembling suggestion of its existence within me.” This intense response to beauty is such that the narrator’s soul seems to disengage from its body, leaving behind only a barely detectible indication of its presence there. In other words, the narrator senses only a trace of soul left in the body. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “suggestion” can refer to an implied or indirectly expressed opinion, the text doesn’t portray the narrator expressing an opinion; instead, the narrator is explaining an experience of intense emotion. Choice C is incorrect. While “suggestion” might be used in some contexts to refer to the tactful expression of a differing viewpoint, it doesn’t refer to the dispute or difference of opinion itself. Moreover, the text doesn’t portray a dispute between characters with differing viewpoints. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “suggestion” might be used to refer to a politely worded command, the text doesn’t portray a scenario in which someone receives such a command.",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. depleted",
    optionB: "B. homogeneous",
    optionC: "C. immature",
    optionD: "D. dispersed",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jha and Kremen’s nding about bees’ foraging behavior. In this context, “homogeneous” means uniform or of the same kind. The text indicates that some models predict that the distance that bees travel when they’re foraging declines as the density of owers increases. The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identied a circumstance in which bees don’t behave this way. Specically, if bees encounter “patches of low species richness”—that is, patches in which the owers are largely from the same species—they’ll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources. This context thus suggests that bees don’t behave as some models predict if the dense patches of owers the bees encounter are homogeneous. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave differently than some models predict if the bees encounter ower patches that are not rich in species, not if the owers are “depleted,” or emptied or reduced in quality or quantity. Although it could be true that bees are likely to leave depleted patches in search of more resources, the text doesn’t indicate that Jha and Kremen investigated that possibility. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that bees will not behave as some models predict if owers in patches are “immature,” or not fully developed. Instead, the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave contrary to some models’ predictions if the ower patches are not rich in species. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that bees’ behavior will be inconsistent with the predictions of some models if the ower patches that the bees encounter are of low species richness, not if the owers are in patches that are “dispersed,” or widely scattered. Although the text does describe bees as leaving patches that are not rich in species to forage elsewhere, there’s no suggestion that Jha and Kremen found that the distance between dense ower patches affects whether the bees behave as some models predict.",

    optionA: "A. engulfs",
    optionB: "B. encourages",
    optionC: "C. comprises",
    optionD: "D. provokes",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Gardley’s play. In this context, “comprises” means constitutes or makes up the totality of, and the text indicates that The House That Will Not Stand had an “all-female cast” that stands in some relationship to “an array of female characters” in the play. Because all cast members are female, the characters must be played by these female cast members; therefore the cast constitutes, or comprises, the collection of characters. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, “engulfs” would mean encloses or overwhelms, and although it is fairly common to describe an actor as embodying (or personifying realistically) a character, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the cast members enclosed or overwhelmed the characters they played. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “encourages” would mean inspires with courage or hope. Although the text does mention “a strong mother and several daughters dealing with individual struggles,” which might suggest that there are moments of encouragement among the characters during the play, there is nothing to suggest that the cast members encouraged the characters they portrayed. Choice D is incorrect because, in this context, “provokes” would mean instigates or incites to anger.

    question:
      "Text 1 Despite its beautiful prose, The Guns of August, Barbara Tuchman’s 1962 analysis of the start of World War I, has certain weaknesses as a work of history. It fails to address events in Eastern Europe just before the outbreak of hostilities, thereby giving the impression that Germany was the war’s principal instigator. Had Tuchman consulted secondary works available to her by scholars such as Luigi Albertini, she would not have neglected the inuence of events in Eastern Europe on Germany’s actions. Text 2 Barbara Tuchman’s The Guns of August is an engrossing if dated introduction to World War I. Tuchman’s analysis of primary documents is laudable, but her main thesis that European powers committed themselves to a catastrophic outcome by refusing to deviate from military plans developed prior to the conict is implausibly reductive. Which choice best describes a difference in how the authors of Text 1 and Text 2 view Barbara Tuchman’s The Guns of August?",
    optionA:

      "D. The author of Text 1 claims that Tuchman would agree that World War I was largely due to events in Eastern Europe, while the author of Text 2 maintains that\nTuchman would say that Eastern European leaders were not committed to military plans in the same way that other leaders were.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. Both texts are critical of The Guns of August, but for different reasons: the author of Text 1 argues that Tuchman missed an important factor leading up to the war because she didn’t consult secondary sources, and the author of Text 2 argues that Tuchman’s main thesis is "reductive," which is a close synonym for "overly simplistic." Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t accurately describe the difference. This choice’s summary of Text 1 is accurate, but Text 2 never says that Tuchman’s most interesting claims result from her original research. Choice C is incorrect.

    optionD: "D. Fullls",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:

In the text, Fabry and Busman claim that the robots manufactured by their company are more ecient than human workers, which they refer to as “the human machine.” Fabry observes that the human machine “no longer answers the requirements of modern engineering.” That is, human workers are incapable of meeting the rigorous needs of modern, industrialized workplaces.

Storey also found that the El Arenal chicken shared a unique genetic mutation with the ancient chicken breeds of the Polynesian Islands in the Pacic. Thus, Polynesian peoples, not later Europeans, probably rst introduced chickens to South America. Text 2 An Australian research team weakened the case for a Polynesian origin for the El Arenal chicken by conrming that the mutation identied by Storey has occurred in breeds from around the world. More recently, though, a team led by Agusto Luzuriaga-Neira found that South American chicken breeds and Polynesian breeds share other genetic markers that European breeds lack. Thus, the preponderance of evidence now favors a Polynesian origin. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By broadly agreeing with the claim but objecting that the timeline it presupposes conicts with the ndings of the genetic analysis conducted by Storey’s team",
    optionB:
      "B. By faulting the claim for implying that domestic animals couldn’t have been transferred from South America to the Polynesian Islands as well",

      "C. By critiquing the claim for being based on an assumption that before the European invasion of South America, the chickens of Europe were genetically uniform",
    optionD:
      "D. By noting that while the claim is persuasive, the ndings of Luzuriaga-Neira’s team provide stronger evidence for it than the ndings of the genetic analysis\nconducted by Storey do",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were rst brought to South America by Polynesian people. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Storey found is in chickens from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of a Polynesian origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say “[m]ore recently” Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but “that European breeds lack,” which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira’s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey’s evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues’ evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey’s evidence is. Choice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from “1321–1407 CE—over a century before Europeans invaded the region” and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey’s account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were rst brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way decient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens. There is nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the underlined sentence (Storey’s conclusion) is decient because it is based on an assumption about the genetic uniformity of European chickens.",

    optionD:
      "D. To depict the setting as the characters await a visitor’s arrival",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately reects the main purpose of the text. The text portrays Miss Pyne as awaiting the arrival of a carriage while Martha brings strawberries and owers from the garden into the house. The text also describes the surroundings of the scene, stating that Miss Pyne looks “stately and calm,” the evening is bright and cool, and birds are singing in the garden as the sun sets. Then the last sentence states that the house was “wide open to the long-expected guest,” which strongly suggests that Miss Pyne’s anticipation and Martha’s activities were in preparation for the guest who is expected to arrive in the carriage. Thus, the text depicts the setting and conveys what these characters are doing as they await the arrival of their visitor. Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that the characters feel any worry about the guest’s arrival. The text indicates that the guest was “long-expected,“ but characterizing Miss Pyne as “stately and calm” conicts with the idea that the characters are worried about the guest.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claims of the author of Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By arguing that a piece of art created digitally can still be displayed traditionally",
    optionB:
      "B. By explaining that it’s actually much harder to use a tablet and stylus to create art than to use paint and a brush",
    optionC:
      "C. By insisting that digital art requires artistic abilities and skill even if it employs less traditional tools",
    optionD:
      "D. By admitting that most digital artists don’t think fundamental drawing skills are important",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 2 would respond to the claims in Text 1. Both texts address skills needed to produce digital art. Text 1 claims that digital art doesn’t require the same amount of skill as creating physical art and that “the technology is doing most of the work.” Text 2 states that digital art requires “knowing the fundamentals of art” and that many digital artists begin their work on paper and then transfer it to a digital format using “sophisticated software” and “a variety of colors and techniques.” Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely insist that digital art requires artistic abilities even if it employs less traditional tools. Choice A is incorrect because neither text discusses nondigital means of displaying art. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 doesn’t address whether it’s harder to use a tablet and stylus than it is to use paint and a brush. Text 2 does argue that digital art requires skills that aren’t part of the traditional methods for producing art, but the text doesn’t address relative diculty. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 2 states that digital artists still need to know “the fundamentals of art” and that many digital artists begin their work by drafting on paper before transferring the work to a digital format.",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. unpredictable",
    optionB: "B. important",
    optionC: "C. secretive",
    optionD: "D. ordinary",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Juarez. In this context, “important” means marked by signicant work or consequence. The text indicates that Juarez, who was the rst president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, became a certain kind of gure in Mexico’s history. It then supports that claim by describing some of the “many signicant accomplishments” from Juarez’s long tenure in oce. This context conveys that Juarez is a signicant and consequential gure in Mexico’s history. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on Juarez’s role as the rst president of Mexico from an Indigenous community and on his many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in oce; nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was “unpredictable,” or tended to behave in ways that couldn’t be predicted. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was a particularly “secretive” gure, or that he tended to keep things private or hidden from others. Instead, the text focuses on things that are known about Juarez: that he was the rst president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, that he had a lengthy tenure, and that his many major accomplishments included consolidating the national government’s authority and advancing Indigenous rights. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on the idea that Juarez, who was the rst president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, had many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in oce. Rather than suggesting that Juarez was an “ordinary,” or common and typical, gure in Mexico’s history, this context conveys that Juarez was instead a notable gure.",

    question:
      "Text 1 A tiny, unusual fossil in a piece of 99-million-year-old amber is of the extinct species Oculudentavis khaungraae. The O. khaungraae fossil consists of a rounded skull with a thin snout and a large eye socket. Because these features look like they are avian, or related to birds, researchers initially thought that the fossil might be the smallest avian dinosaur ever found. Text 2 Paleontologists were excited to discover a second small fossil that is similar to the strange O. khaungraae fossil but has part of the lower body along with a birdlike skull. Detailed studies of both fossils revealed several traits that are found in lizards but not in dinosaurs or birds. Therefore, paleontologists think the two creatures were probably unusual lizards, even though the skulls looked avian at rst. Based on the texts, what would the paleontologists in Text 2 most likely say about the researchers’ initial thought in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. It is understandable because the fossil does look like it could be related to birds, even though O. khaungraae is probably a lizar",
    optionB:
      "B. It is confusing because it isn’t clear what caused the researchers to think that O. khaungraae might be related to birds.",
    optionC:
      "C. It is awed because the researchers mistakenly assumed that O. khaungraae must be a lizar",
    optionD:
      "D. It is reasonable because the O. khaungraae skull is about the same size as the skull of the second fossil but is shaped differently.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it reects what the paleontologists in Text 2 would most likely say about what the researchers in Text 1 initially thought. Text 1 focuses on the discovery of a strange fossil consisting of the skull of the extinct species Oculudentavis khaungraae. According to Text 1, the fossil has features that appear to be avian, or related to birds, which led researchers to initially think that the fossil might be a very small avian dinosaur. Text 2 begins by noting the discovery of a second fossil similar to the one discussed in Text 1, then explains that based on detailed studies of both fossils, paleontologists think that the two creatures were probably unusual lizards, even though the skulls appeared avian at rst. This suggests that the paleontologists in Text 2 recognize that the fossils do indeed look like they could be related to birds. For this reason, the paleontologists in Text 2 would most likely say that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1—that the fossil was avian—is understandable, even if the fossil is probably not avian but rather is from a lizard. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the fossils initially looked avian, so the paleontologists described in Text 2 wouldn’t be confused by the researchers in Text 1 initially thinking that O. khaungraae might be related to birds. The paleontologists would nd that initial thought understandable, not confusing. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 never mentions lizards, so it wouldn’t make sense for the paleontologists in Text 2 to say that the researchers in Text 1 mistakenly assumed that O. khaungraae must be a lizard. Choice D is incorrect. Although the paleontologists in Text 2 might agree that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1 was reasonable, nothing in Text 2 suggests that the two skulls were shaped differently.",

The rest of the text offers specic examples of the small pieces of evidence. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The fact that we only know about these lost early lms from small pieces of evidence isn’t presented as a “complex problem”—that’s too extreme. And the examples presented are not “unsuccessful attempts” to solve it. If anything, the examples represent a success, because we discovered that these lms existed in the rst place. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. There’s no “debate” presented in the text, so there’s no “side” for the text to support. Choice D is incorrect.

      "The following text is adapted from Louise Erdrich’s 2020 novel The Night Watchman. Louis Pipestone is collecting signatures for a petition from fellow members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa on the tribe’s reservation in North Dakota. Louis Pipestone tended the petition like a garden. He kept it with him at all times. In town, his eyes sharpened when he noticed a tribal member who hadn’t yet signed. Wherever they were—at the gas pump, mercantile [general store], at Henry’s [Café], on the road, or outside the clinic and hospital—Louis cornered them. If they were waiting for a baby to be born, he’d have them sign. If they were laughing, if they were arguing. If they were taking a child home from school, they signed. ©2020 by Louise Erdrich Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To suggest that some tribal members refuse to sign the petition because they dislike Louis Pipestone",
    optionB:
      "B. To show that attitudes toward the petition within the tribal community change over time",
    optionC:
      "C. To demonstrate that most tribal members are enthusiastic about signing the petition",
    optionD:
      "D. To portray Louis Pipestone’s strong commitment to collecting signatures for the petition",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the text’s main purpose. The text indicates that Louis always had his petition with him, asked everyone he encountered to sign it if they hadn’t already, and lists several comical circumstances in which he might try to get someone to sign. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Louis’s dedicated focus on getting people to sign the petition. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Louis was aggressive in seeking signatures for the petition—for example, saying that he "cornered" people— nothing in the text addresses how those people feel toward Louis, let alone that they are refusing his request. Choice B is incorrect because, other than portraying Louis’s commitment to gathering signatures, the text doesn’t discuss community members’ attitudes toward Louis or the petition. Choice C is incorrect because the text never mentions the attitudes of the people Louis approaches toward the petition, but the text does indicate that he "cornered" prospective signatories, strongly suggesting that their enthusiasm was neither needed nor considered.',

    question:
      "Text 1 It seems clear that emotional contagion (the unintentional transfer of an emotional state from one person to another) requires physical interaction and the observation of body language. After all, research shows that talking to someone who is smiling and expressing positive feelings often causes people to respond in a comparably positive way. Similarly, displays of nervous dgeting have been found to prompt others to begin behaving more nervously, too. Text 2 In an experiment using a social networking service, Zeyao Yang and Emilio Ferrara found evidence of emotional contagion in text-based online interactions. The researchers discovered that reading social media posts that expressed a positive outlook led people to make more positive posts themselves, while posts with a negative emotional tone led people to make more negative posts. Based on the texts, what would the researchers in Text 2 most likely say about the claim underlined in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. It perpetuates a awed understanding of emotional contagion, because there isn’t enough evidence to suggest that smiling is a sign of emotional contagion.",
    optionB:
      "B. It reects an incomplete view of emotional contagion, because this phenomenon can occur even without in-person interaction.",
    optionC:
      "C. It’s fairly persuasive, because studies attempting to identify emotional contagion in situations without in-person interaction have thus far yielded unclear results.",
    optionD:
      "D. It’s mostly accurate, because the social networking study conrmed that emotional contagion primarily occurs in response to negative emotions like\nnervousness.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it represents how the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 begins by asserting that the unintended transfer of feelings from one person to another, known as emotional contagion, seems to rely on both people being physically present and able to observe body language. Text 1 then references research that supports this assertion. Text 2 describes an experiment conducted by the researchers Yang and Ferrara in which they found evidence of emotional contagion in the absence of physical interaction, namely through text-based interactions on social media. The researchers in Text 2 wouldn’t completely agree with what is asserted in the underlined portion of Text 1 (that emotional contagion seems to require physical proximity), because their study, which used a social media networking service, found that physical interaction isn’t the only way that emotional contagion can take place. Thus, the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by stating that it reects an incomplete view of emotional contagion, because the phenomenon can occur without an in-person interaction. Choice A is incorrect. Although the researchers in Text 2 would likely agree that the underlined statement in Text 1 perpetuates a awed conclusion that emotional contagion requires physical interaction, Text 2 doesn’t address what the researchers thought about smiling as a sign of emotional contagion. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers in Text 2 wouldn’t say that the underlined claim in Text 1 is fairly persuasive. According to Text 2, the researchers conducted a study that found emotional contagion didn’t require physical interaction, because they found evidence of it in text-based online interactions. Choice D is incorrect because neither of the texts claim that emotional contagion primarily occurs when a person is exposed to negativity. Instead, Text 1 claims that physical interaction is required for emotional contagion to occur, and Text 2 describes a study that suggests emotional contagion can occur in text-based online interactions.",

      "D. The speaker addresses a criticism leveled against him, then announces a grand ambition of his.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the overall structure of the text. The speaker begins by stating that he has heard that others are accusing him of seeking to destroy institutions. The speaker then addresses this criticism by stating that he is “neither for nor against institutions.” Instead, the speaker states that his ultimate goal is to instill “the institution of the dear love of comrades” everywhere in the country. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as an address of criticism followed by an announcement of a grand ambition. Choice A is incorrect. While the speaker does address an opinion of him that he believes to be untrue, he doesn’t indicate that this attitude has become increasingly prevalent. The speaker also concludes by explaining his goal for the future rather than his current worldview. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray the speaker as isolated or regretful, and the speaker gestures toward a hope for societal change but doesn’t offer an explicit prediction that it will happen.

    optionB: "B. denied",
    optionC: "C. worried",
    optionD: "D. predicted",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the fashion resale market’s continued growth. As used in this context, “predicted” means forecast, or indicated that something would happen in the future. The text indicates that the fashion resale market made a lot of money in 2019 and that some analysts expected the market to continue to grow. This context suggests that the analysts believed that the fashion resale market was going to make more money than it had already made, with the analysts indicating that revenues would more than double by 2028. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that some analysts “produced,” or manufactured or brought about, the increase in future revenues of the fashion resale market. The analysts themselves couldn’t have brought about the future revenue growth, since, as the text suggests, they were merely in the position of drawing conclusions about future fashion resale market revenue based on 2019 revenue. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they “denied,” or rejected, this notion. Nothing in the text supports the idea that these analysts thought the revenues wouldn’t grow. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they “worried,” or felt concerned, that revenue would signicantly increase by 2028. Nothing in the text suggests that the analysts felt concerned about the increase; rather, the text suggests that the increase would represent a favorable outcome, since it would mean that the fashion resale market grew to generate even more revenue.",

    optionC: "C. extensive",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how Ofelia Zepeda has contributed to the eld of linguistics. As used in this context, “extensive” means having a wide or considerable extent. The text indicates that Zepeda’s many accomplishments in linguistics are varied, including teaching linguistics, writing poetry in more than one language, creating a grammar book, and co-founding a language institute. This context supports the idea that Zepeda’s contributions to the eld are extensive. Choice A is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda’s accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the rst part of the sentence. It wouldn’t make sense to say that achievements as a professor, poet and author, and co-founder of a language institute demonstrate that Zepeda’s contributions in her eld are “pragmatic,” or related to practical matters and not involving intellectual or artistic matters. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda’s accomplishments as a professor, poet and author, and co-founder of a language institute as examples to support the claim made in the rst part of the sentence. There’s no reason to believe that the positive achievements listed demonstrate that Zepeda’s contributions in her eld are “controversial,” or have caused disputes and opposing viewpoints. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “universal” would mean including or covering everything in a group. The sentence presents Zepeda’s accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the rst part of the sentence, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that these specic achievements—particularly as the author of a grammar book specic to the Tohono O’odham language—demonstrate that Zepeda’s contributions relate to everything in the eld of linguistics.",

    optionC: "C. Amount",
    optionD: "D. Sketch",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because the text indicates that Fox-Foot doesn’t let the group build a re or create a canoe landing when it’s time for supper. This context suggests that he doesn’t want anyone who might be following the group to see any sign of them or their activities. In other words, Fox-Foot doesn’t want there to be any trace, or evidence, of the group’s movements ("their passing") through the area. Choice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Fox-Foot doesn’t want the group to be detected, not that he doesn’t want their presence to create a blemish, or a spoiling aw, in the area; human activity could disturb a natural environment, but the context emphasizes that Fox-Foot is instead focused on avoiding giving any sign of the group’s movements through a place ("their passing") to anyone who might be following them. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on FoxFoot’s desire to avoid detection by those who might be following the group. This context conveys that Fox-Foot doesn’t want to create any signs or evidence of the group moving through a place ("their passing"), not that he doesn’t want to leave behind some quantity of their presence; indeed, it isn’t clear what an amount of a group’s movement would be. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the group has a sketch, or rough drawing, of their movements through that area ("their passing") that might be left behind.

    optionB: "B. elusive",
    optionC: "C. abrupt",
    optionD: "D. imminent",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of the fossil record from the Cambrian period. In this context, “abrupt” means sudden. The text explains that the fossil record reects the unexpected appearance and rapid diversication, or increase in variety, of animal remains during the Cambrian period. This context establishes that these remains’ entry into the fossil record was sudden. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word “explosion” appears in the name of the event marked by the fossil record change, the text never suggests that the change was “catastrophic,” or disastrous. In context, “explosion” refers to the rapid diversication, or the swift increase in variety, of animal remains in the fossil record—a phenomenon that the text presents in a relatively neutral manner, without commenting on whether it was negative or positive. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that the change toward greater diversication is “elusive,” or dicult to locate, in the fossil record. Rather, the text notes that the change occurred about 541 million years ago, suggesting that scientists have indeed been able to locate it. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to describe the change in the fossil record as “imminent,” or about to occur, since the text indicates that the change already occurred millions of years ago.",

    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Yu’s novel. In this context, “haphazard” means marked by a lack of plan or order. The text indicates that the quest featured in the novel, which involves the protagonist bouncing across time, is chaotic and causes the reader to often wonder what will happen. This context suggests that the protagonist’s journey seems to be marked by a lack of order. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the journey featured in Yu’s novel involves a character “ricocheting chaotically,” or bouncing in a disordered way, across time and causes the reader to often wonder what will happen.

    optionC: "C. ongoing",
    optionD: "D. uniform",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer. The text tells us that the samples are too "small scale" to reect the composition of the asteroid, which probably doesn’t show the same variation on a large scale. This suggests that the mineral composition of the samples are unlikely to be exactly the same from sample to sample. Choice A is incorrect. "Neglected" means "suffering a lack of proper care" or "abandoned," which doesn’t work here. The text never suggests that the distribution of minerals in the samples would be neglected, so this statement doesn’t logically follow. Choice B is incorrect. "Redundant" means "not or no longer useful or needed," which is too strong. The text doesn’t suggest that the variation between the samples isn’t a useful nding at all—just that we can’t assume that the largescale composition of the asteroid will show the same variation. But the composition of the samples might be useful for something else. Choice C is incorrect. "Ongoing" means "still in progress," which doesn’t make sense: the distribution of minerals in a sample can’t be "ongoing."',

      "Some scientists have suggested that mammals in the Mesozoic era were not a very ______ group, but paleontologist Zhe-Xi Luo’s research suggests that early mammals living in the shadow of dinosaurs weren’t all ground-dwelling insectivores. Fossils of various plant-eating mammals have been found in China, including species like Vilevolodon diplomylos, which Luo says could glide like a ying squirrel. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. predatory",
    optionB: "B. obscure",
    optionC: "C. diverse",
    optionD: "D. localized",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the kinds of mammals alive during the Mesozoic era. As used in this context, “diverse” means to have a signicant amount of variety. The text indicates that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals can’t be characterized in a certain way, then contrasts the view put forward by those scientists with Luo’s research, which shows that Mesozoic mammals “weren’t all ground-dwelling insectivores” and instead were “various.” This context suggests that some scientists have viewed Mesozoic mammals as being all alike, or not a very diverse group. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren’t very “predatory,” or that they didn’t prey on other animals, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo’s research showing that Mesozoic mammals “weren’t all ground-dwelling insectivores.” This context suggests that some scientists have regarded Mesozoic mammals as all being insectivores, or animals that prey on insects, not that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals didn’t prey on other animals. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren’t very “obscure,” or concealed or not well known, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo’s research showing that Mesozoic mammals were a varied group. There’s no contrast between saying that the mammals weren’t concealed or well known and the mammals being varied. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren’t very “localized,” or conned to a particular area, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo’s research showing that Mesozoic mammals were a varied group. There’s no contrast between saying that the mammals weren’t localized and the mammals being varied. Although the text mentions mammal fossils found in China, nothing in the discussion of Luo’s research addresses the limits of Mesozoic mammal habitats.",

Most writers prefer working alone, and given that working together cost Hurston and Hughes their friendship, it is not hard to see why. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. characterization",
    optionB: "B. interpretation",
    optionC: "C. collaboration",
    optionD: "D. commercialization",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of The Mule Bone, a play that Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes wrote together. In this context, “collaboration” means working together with someone to write a literary work. The text indicates that most writers prefer to work alone and that working together destroyed the friendship between Hurston and Hughes. This establishes that The Mule Bone is a relatively rare example of collaboration in literature. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “characterization” would mean a literary work’s portrayal of characters’ psychological experiences and motivations, but the text doesn’t discuss characterization in The Mule Bone specically or in collaborative works more generally. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “interpretation” would mean the explanation of a literary work’s meaning or signicance, but the text doesn’t discuss how readers or critics have interpreted The Mule Bone; instead, the text discusses how the play was written collaboratively and how the writing process affected the two authors. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “commercialization” would mean writing a literary work in such a way as to ensure its commercial appeal, but the text never discusses commercial appeal as a factor in the writing of The Mule Bone specically or the writing of collaborative works more generally.",

The delays are unlikely to ______ her projection entirely but will almost certainly extend its time frame. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. dispute",
    optionB: "B. withdraw",
    optionC: "C. underscore",
    optionD: "D. invalidate",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the economist’s claim about sales of personal electronic devices. In this context, “invalidate” most nearly means nullify or make invalid. The text indicates that interruptions in the supply of microchips for personal electronics “have challenged” the economist’s claim that sales of personal electronics will show strong growth in the coming months. The text goes on to clarify the effect of the delays on the economist’s projection, stating that the delays are very likely to extend the time frame over which the projected growth in sales will occur. This context suggests that the delays are unlikely to invalidate the economist’s projection entirely—the delays will probably alter the time frame of the projection, not nullify it or make it invalid. Choice A is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “dispute,” or argue against, the economist’s projection wouldn’t make sense. Since the delays are an inanimate circumstance, they couldn’t argue against a prediction about the sales of personal electronics. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “withdraw,” or remove from consideration, the economist’s projection wouldn’t make sense. Although the economist could withdraw her projection because of the delays, the delays themselves couldn’t withdraw her projection since they’re an inanimate circumstance and thus can’t choose to remove something from consideration. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the delays will “underscore,” or emphasize, the economist’s projection. Instead, the text suggests that the delays are likely to extend the time frame of the economist’s projection but not to undermine the projection entirely.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text presents information about a map drawn by Blackfoot chief Ac Ko Mok Ki in 1801. The underlined sentence states that the map "demonstrates a vast amount of topographic knowledge" and mentions that it features the "specic names of mountains and rivers" and includes the rst-known sketch of the Missouri River’s drainage network. These are all characteristics that indicate that the map was executed with remarkable skill. Thus, the underlined sentence identies some reasons why the map is impressive. Choice A is incorrect. Though the sentence after the underlined sentence in the text mentions that Ac Ko Mok Ki included information about other tribes on his map, the underlined sentence itself does not address this topic. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence indicates how Ac Ko Mok Ki became interested in mapmaking, only that his mapmaking skills are impressive. Choice D is incorrect because though the underlined sentence describes several features of the map, it does not specically describe how the map was used.',

    optionB: "B. supplement to",
    optionC: "C. beneciary of",
    optionD: "D. distraction for",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Francis Cecil Sumner. As used in this context, “proponent of” means supporter of. The text says that Sumner helped to found the psychology department at historically Black Howard University in 1930. This is evidence that Sumner supported increasing the opportunity for Black students to study psychology. Choice B is incorrect because the phrase “supplement to,” or addition to, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text discusses Sumner’s efforts to increase the number of Black psychology students, but it doesn’t make sense to describe him as an addition to his efforts. Choice C is incorrect because Sumner was already an accomplished psychologist himself when he helped to found the Howard University psychology department. While Black students were the beneciaries of his efforts—that is, they received help because of his efforts—it wouldn’t make sense in this context to describe Sumner as a “beneciary of” opportunities, because he was the one doing the helping. Choice D is incorrect because founding a psychology department at Howard University wouldn’t be a “distraction for” Sumner’s aim to increase the opportunity for Black students to study psychology—that is, it wouldn’t be something that draws Sumner’s attention away from that goal, but rather the opposite.",

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. resolved",
    optionB: "B. adjusted",
    optionC: "C. offered",
    optionD: "D. directed",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about how, for Schoenemann, a damaged trilobite fossil was informative. In context, “offered” means provided or gave. The text suggests that although it may seem counterintuitive, a broken fossilized trilobite allowed Schoenemann to observe more details of the trilobite’s eye than an intact fossilized trilobite would. This context conveys the idea that a damaged fossil offered, or provided, fresh insight into the structure of a trilobite’s eye. Choice A is incorrect because “resolved” means determined or gured out, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text focuses on how Schoenemann was able to get more information from a broken fossil than an intact one. Although the damaged fossil may have allowed her to determine certain information, as an inanimate object the fossil isn’t capable of resolving anything. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the broken part of a trilobite fossil “adjusted,” or changed or modied, fresh insight wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text focuses on how Schoenemann was able to get more information from a broken fossil than an intact one. This context suggests that the fossil offered fresh insight, or understanding, not that it adjusted fresh insight. Choice D is incorrect because “directed” means managed or instructed, which wouldn’t make sense in this context.

The rst sentence presents the general claim that industrial activity is not always a threat to wildlife. The underlined portion of the sentence that follows suggests that the silver-studded blue buttery is an example of wildlife thriving in areas of industrial activity: active limestone quarries. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to introduce a specic example in support of the general claim in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect. Although the rst sentence indicates that “industrial activity is often assumed” to harm wildlife, in the case of the silver-studded blue buttery the text mentions neither an assumption about this species nor any challenge to such an assumption.

Anne reveled in the world of color about her. “Oh, Marilla,” she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs, “I’m so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn’t it? Look at these maple branches. Don’t they give you a thrill—several thrills? I’m going to decorate my room with them.” “Messy things,” said Marilla, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed. “You clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors stuff, Anne. Bedrooms were made to sleep in.” Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",

    optionC:
      "C. To emphasize Marilla’s disapproval of how Anne has decorated her room",
    optionD:
      "D. To show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by noting that Anne “reveled in the world of color about her”—that is, she takes great delight in colorful things. It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it. The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped “aesthetic sense,” or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as “messy things” and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside. This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities. Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne’s appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn’t show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla’s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne’s personality.",

    optionC: "C. calibrations with",
    optionD: "D. incentives for",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of solar energy collection and storage. In this context, "uctuations in" means irregular changes in. The text notes that economists recommend that countries that want to rely more on solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) should attempt to expand their storage capacity. The text goes on to explain that having a large amount of stored solar energy can lessen the negative effect of "unpredictable shifts in cloud cover and haze"—that is, unpredictable changes in environmental conditions that at times limit sunlight. This context suggests that having ample solar energy stored and ready to use can mitigate the issue of uctuations in solar energy collection caused by irregular patterns of sunlight availability. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "developments of solar energy collection" would most clearly refer to the creation of ways to collect solar energy (energy captured from sunlight). The text focuses on collection and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight ("cloud cover and haze"); there’s no reason to think that the creation of new collection methods would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "calibrations with" would most clearly refer to precise adjustments for a particular purpose. The text focuses on the collection of solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight ("cloud cover and haze"); there’s no reason to think that precision in something related to solar energy collection would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated. Choice D is incorrect.

According to the text, a study of the single-celled protozoan Stentor roeseli showed that the organisms can switch strategies for escaping certain stimuli, “sophisticatedly ‘changing their minds’” and using new strategies should other strategies fail. This context suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic or rudimentary, since the study showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “aggressive,” or threatening.

[Atlante] gave this letter to Charlot; who immediately ran into the balcony with it, where she still found Rinaldo in a melancholy posture, leaning his head on his hand: She showed him the letter, but was afraid to toss it to him, for fear it might fall to the ground; so he ran and fetched a long cane, which he cleft at one end, and held it while she put the letter into the cleft, and stayed not to hear what he said to it. But never was man so transported with joy, as he was at the reading of this letter; it gives him new wounds; for to the generous, nothing obliges love so much as love.

    optionD:
      "D. It reveals the inspiration behind a character’s letter, and then emphasizes the excitement that another character feels upon receiving that letter.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The narrator begins by explaining how Charlot carefully delivers Atlante’s letter to Rinaldo, and then relates that Rinaldo feels “transported with joy” after reading the letter. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description of the delivery of a letter followed by the portrayal of a character’s happiness after reading the letter. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the letter has been written; there’s no explanation why another character hasn’t written one. In addition, the text’s description of Rinaldo “in a melancholy posture” suggests that he’s sad and thoughtful, not that he’s desperate to receive the letter. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Charlot won’t toss the letter to Rinaldo because she doesn’t want it to fall, the text doesn’t refer to the contents of the letter.

      "Text 1 In a study of insect behavior, Samadi Galpayage and colleagues presented bumblebees with small wooden balls and observed many of the bees clinging to, rolling, and dragging the objects. The researchers provided no external rewards (such as food) to encourage these interactions. The bees simply appeared to be playing— and for no other reason than because they were having fun. Text 2 Insects do not have cortexes or other brain areas associated with emotions in humans. Still, Galpayage and her team have shown that bumblebees may engage in play, possibly experiencing some kind of positive emotional state. Other studies have suggested that bees experience negative emotional states (for example, stress), but as Galpayage and her team have acknowledged, emotions in insects, if they do indeed exist, are likely very rudimentary. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined portion of Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By objecting that the bees were actually experiencing a negative feeling akin to stress rather than a positive feeling",
    optionB:
      "B. By arguing that some insects other than bumblebees may be capable of experiencing complex emotional states",
    optionC:
      "C. By pointing out that even humans sometimes struggle to have fun while engaging in play",
    optionD:
      "D. By noting that if the bees were truly playing, any positive feelings they may have experienced were probably quite basic",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 agrees with the author of Text 1 that bumblebees may engage in play and possibly experience some kind of positive emotional state. However, the author of Text 2 also qualies this claim by stating that emotions in insects, if they do exist, are “likely very rudimentary.” Choice A is incorrect. While Text 2 states that other studies might indicate “negative emotional states” in bees, it does not contradict the ndings from the Galpayage study—that the bees might have been having fun. Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does not mention or imply that any insects, including bumblebees, are capable of experiencing complex emotional states. The author of Text 2 states that if insects do feel emotions, those emotions are “likely very rudimentary.” Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does not compare or contrast the behavior or emotions of insects and humans, and neither does the author of Text 1.",

      "Genetic studies have led researchers to suggest that turtles are most closely related to the group that includes modern crocodiles. But studies of fossils have suggested instead that turtles are most closely related to other groups, such as the one that contains modern snakes. However, many of the fossil studies have relied on incomplete data sets. For a 2022 investigation, biologist Tiago R. Simões and colleagues examined more than 1,000 reptile fossils collected worldwide. From this large data set, they found clear agreement with the results of the genetic studies.

      "Text 1 Many studies in psychology have shown that people seek out information even when they know in advance that they have no immediate use for it and that they won’t directly benet from it. Such ndings support the consensus view among researchers of curiosity: namely, that curiosity is not instrumental but instead represents a drive to acquire information for its own sake. Text 2 While acknowledging that acquiring information is a powerful motivator, Rachit Dubey and colleagues ran an experiment to test whether emphasizing the usefulness of scientic information could increase curiosity about it. They found that when research involving rats and fruit ies was presented as having medical applications for humans, participants expressed greater interest in learning about it than when the research was not presented as useful. Based on the texts, how would Dubey and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the consensus view discussed in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By suggesting that curiosity may not be exclusively motivated by the desire to merely acquire information",
    optionB:
      "B. By conceding that people may seek out information that serves no immediate purpose only because they think they can use it later",
    optionC:

    optionD:
      "D. By disputing the idea that curiosity can help explain apparently purposeless information-seeking behaviors",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. The researchers in Text 2 recognize that acquiring information is a powerful motivator, but showed that this motivation can still be affected by other factors, like whether or not the information is expected to be useful or not. This suggests that other desires may play a part in driving people to acquire information. Choice B is incorrect. The consensus view in Text 1 is that people acquire information regardless of whether they think they can use it later. Dubey and colleagues acknowledge this fact (so they don’t claim people seek out information “only” because it might be useful later). Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the results of Dubey and colleagues’ study in Text 2. Neither text discusses the diculty of determining the motivation for information-seeking. Choice D is incorrect. This choice contradicts Text 2, which starts with Dubey and colleagues “acknowledging that acquiring information is a powerful motivator” (i.e., agreeing that curiosity explains the seeking of apparently purposeless information). The research in Text 2 simply suggests that more than just curiosity can motivate information-seeking behavior when the information has a purpose.",

    question:
      "Text 1 Conventional wisdom long held that human social systems evolved in stages, beginning with hunter-gatherers forming small bands of members with roughly equal status. The shift to agriculture about 12,000 years ago sparked population growth that led to the emergence of groups with hierarchical structures: associations of clans rst, then chiefdoms, and nally, bureaucratic states. Text 2 In a 2021 book, anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow maintain that humans have always been socially exible, alternately forming systems based on hierarchy and collective ones with decentralized leadership. The authors point to evidence that as far back as 50,000 years ago some huntergatherers adjusted their social structures seasonally, at times dispersing in small groups but also assembling into communities that included esteemed individuals. Based on the texts, how would Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” presented in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By conceding the importance of hierarchical systems but asserting the greater signicance of decentralized collective societies",
    optionB:
      "B. By disputing the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages",

      "C. By acknowledging that hierarchical roles likely weren’t a part of social systems before the rise of agriculture",
    optionD:
      "D. By challenging the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it describes the most likely way that Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) would respond to the “conventional wisdom” presented in Text 1. According to Text 1, the conventional wisdom about human social systems is that they developed through stages, beginning with hunter-gatherer bands, then moving to clan associations, then chiefdoms, and nally arriving at states with bureaucratic structures. Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow believe that human social systems have been exible, shifting between different types of structures, including both hierarchical and collective systems, and that these shifts may have even occurred seasonally. This suggests that Graeber and Wengrow would dispute the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that Graeber and Wengrow believe that decentralized collective societies are more signicant than hierarchical systems. Text 2 is focused on Graeber and Wengrow’s view that humans have exibly shifted among various social structures, not on the importance of particular structures relative to others. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t include any information suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow believe that hierarchies didn’t emerge until after the rise of agriculture. In fact, Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow cite evidence suggesting that some hunter-gatherer groups formed social structures with hierarchical elements (“communities that included esteemed individuals”) 50,000 years ago, long before the rise of agriculture, which Text 1 says occurred around 12,000 years ago. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no information in Text 2 suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow would challenge the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure. Although Text 1 does indicate that hunter-gatherer groups are assumed to be the earliest human social system, Text 2 says only that Graeber and Wengrow believe that some hunter-gatherer groups made use of different social structures at different times. Text 2 doesn’t imply that Graeber and Wengrow doubt that hunter-gatherer groups preceded most other social structures.",

      "Text 1 The fossil record suggests that mammoths went extinct around 11 thousand years (kyr) ago. In a 2021 study of environmental DNA (eDNA)—genetic material shed into the environment by organisms—in the Arctic, Yucheng Wang and colleagues found mammoth eDNA in sedimentary layers formed millennia later, around 4 kyr ago. To account for this discrepancy, Joshua H. Miller and Carl Simpson proposed that arctic temperatures could preserve a mammoth carcass on the surface, allowing it to leach DNA into the environment, for several thousand years. Text 2 Wang and colleagues concede that eDNA contains DNA from both living organisms and carcasses, but for DNA to leach from remains over several millennia requires that the remains be perpetually on the surface. Scavengers and weathering in the Arctic, however, are likely to break down surface remains well before a thousand years have passed. Which choice best describes how Text 1 and Text 2 relate to each other?",
    optionA:
      "A. Text 1 discusses two approaches to studying mammoth extinction without advocating for either, whereas Text 2 advocates for one approach over the other.",

    optionD:
      "D. Text 1 argues that new research has undermined the standard view of when mammoths went extinct, whereas Text 2 suggests a way to reconcile the standard\nview with that new research.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer. Text 1 introduces Wang and colleagues’ study and its surprising results, and then mentions Miller and Simpson’s hypothesis as a possible way to explain them. Text 2, however, challenges Miller and Simpson’s hypothesis by pointing out the diculties of preserving mammoth carcasses on the surface for thousands of years: “scavengers and weathering” are the additional details that complicate the Miller/Simpson hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text compares two different approaches for studying mammoth extinction. Text 1 describes one study and one hypothesis pertaining to it. Text 2 critiques that hypothesis. Choice C is incorrect. Text 1 does not describe a critique of Wang and colleagues’ methodology, but rather an interpretation of their results by Miller and Simpson. Text 2 does not offer additional details showing that methodology to be sound, but rather casts doubt on the Miller/Simpson explanation. Choice D is incorrect. Both components mentioned here (the new “undermining” research and the theory for reconciling this discovery) are contained in Text 1.

    optionC: "C. criteria for",
    optionD: "D. forfeiture of",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. "Exposure to" means "having contact with." It makes sense that Prasad and Bainbridge were investigating whether seeing false versions of images was a cause of false visual memories. Notice how "exposure to incorrect renditions" matches the idea of "familiarity with erroneous versions," which appears later in the sentence. Choice A is incorrect. "Compliance with" means "going along with a command or directive." False versions of images can’t give commands or directives, so this doesn’t apply. Choice C is incorrect. "Criteria" means "standards by which to judge something." It’s not clear how people would come to have standards for the wrong version of an image in the rst place, let alone how those standards would cause them to falsely remember the correct version. In other words, this choice would result in a confusing, unclear sentence. Choice D is incorrect. "Forfeiture of" means "a giving up of something."

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of programs that encourage money to cycle within a community. In this context, "instituting" means initiating. The text indicates that making purchases at small local businesses can help keep money cycling within a community. The text goes on to state that some cities are establishing incentives to promote small business shopping. This context supports the idea that some cities are instituting programs to encourage this consumer behavior. Choice B is incorrect because saying that some cities are "occupying," or forcibly holding possession or control of, programs that encourage shoppers to make purchases at small local businesses wouldn’t make sense in context. The text doesn’t discuss who controls these programs but instead indicates that some cities are establishing incentives that encourage shoppers to make purchases at small local businesses. Furthermore, it wouldn’t make sense to say that a city is occupying a program. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that cities are "underestimating," or failing to understand the value of, programs that encourage consumers to shop at small local businesses. The text indicates that some cities are establishing incentives to encourage small business shopping, which suggests that these cities understand the value of such programs. Choice D is incorrect because saying that some cities are "encountering," or coming into contact with, programs that encourage consumers to shop at small local businesses wouldn’t make sense in context.

      "Text 1 Although food writing is one of the most widely read genres in the United States, literary scholars have long neglected it. And within this genre, cookbooks attract the least scholarly attention of all, regardless of how well written they may be. This is especially true of works dedicated to regional US cuisines, whose complexity and historical signicance are often overlooked. Text 2 With her 1976 cookbook The Taste of Country Cooking, Edna Lewis popularized the rened Southern cooking she had grown up with in Freetown, an all-Black community in Virginia. She also set a new standard for cookbook writing: the recipes and memoir passages interspersing them are written in prose more elegant than that of most novels. Yet despite its inarguable value as a piece of writing, Lewis’s masterpiece has received almost no attention from literary scholars. Based on the two texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely regard the situation presented in the underlined sentence in Text 2?",
    optionA:

    optionC: "C. Basic",
    optionD: "D. Vague",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "rough" most nearly means harsh, or forceful and unpleasant. The text describes Mary’s surroundings as she plays: the sun is out and there’s "a little wind." To further illustrate the wind, the narrator contrasts the word "rough" with a description of the wind blowing in "delightful little gusts," suggesting that the wind is not unpleasant or harsh at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts "rough" objects, or objects with irregular surfaces, can sometimes be scratchy, rough doesn’t mean scratchy in this context. The text explains that the wind is not rough but rather gentle, "delightful little gusts," which suggests that the use of "rough" here is referring to the degree of force of the wind. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wind wasn’t "basic," or simple and uncomplicated. Instead, the text describes the wind as blowing not roughly or harshly but in "delightful little gusts." Choice D is incorrect because the word "vague" means not clearly expressed or seen.

To me alone it is a time of pause, A void and silent space between two worlds, When inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps, Gathering strength for efforts yet to come.

    optionD: "D. An incomplete",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, a span of time is described as "a void" space, which most nearly means an empty or vacant one. In the text, the speaker describes summertime in counterintuitive terms: although nature’s "surging life is at its full" during the season, the speaker feels summer to be "a time of pause, / A void and silent space between two worlds." The speaker says further that during summer, "feeling sleeps / Gathering strength" for future efforts. Thus, the speaker regards summer as an empty stretch of time, to be followed by a period of greater activity. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does present summer as a time of inactivity, it doesn’t characterize that inactivity as useless, or as having no purpose; in fact, the speaker regards summer as a time when "feeling" gathers "strength for efforts yet to come." Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes summer as a time "when inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps," it doesn’t discuss the season’s relationship to the speaker’s memory or suggest that summer can easily be forgotten. Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, "void" can mean devoid of, or lacking, a particular element, and such a lack could be conceived of as incompleteness.

    optionC: "C. perceive",
    optionD: "D. conform to",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jemisin’s writing. In this context, “conform to” means to act in accordance with something. The text suggests that in her science ction writing, Jemisin’s willingness to go against expectations and not use plots and themes that seem to follow a formula reects how she treats the standard practices of the genre. This context conveys that Jemisin chooses not to act in accordance with those conventions. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, “question” would mean doubt or object to. The text indicates that Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes in her science ction writing, suggesting that she may actually object to those conventions of the genre, not that she chooses not to question them. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that in her science ction writing, Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes. Rather than suggesting that Jemisin chooses not to “react to,” or act in response to, the standard practices of the genre, this context suggests that she is acting in response to such conventions by deliberately avoiding them. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, “perceive” would mean become aware of or understand. The text indicates that in her science ction writing, Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes. This context conveys that Jemisin is aware of and deliberately avoids those conventions of the genre, not that she chooses not to be aware of them.",

      "Rydra Wong, the protagonist of Samuel R. Delany’s 1966 novel Babel-17, is a poet, an occupation which, in Delany’s work, is not ______: nearly a dozen of the characters that populate his novels are poets or writers. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. infallible",
    optionB: "B. atypical",
    optionC: "C. lucrative",
    optionD: "D. tedious",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Samuel R. Delany’s character Rydra Wong. As used in this context, “atypical” would mean unrepresentative or not common. The text indicates that Wong is one of “nearly a dozen” characters in Delany’s novels who are poets or writers. This context conveys that being a poet isn’t an atypical occupation for a character in one of Delany’s works. Choice A is incorrect because “infallible” means to be accurate or without fault, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the fact that Delany has written many characters who are poets and writers. This context suggests that the occupation isn’t atypical for Delany, not that the occupation isn’t infallible, or problematic. Choice C is incorrect because “lucrative” means to be protable, which wouldn’t make sense in context. If writing poet characters weren’t protable, it wouldn’t be logical to explain this by citing that Delany gave many of his characters the same occupation. Choice D is incorrect because “tedious” means to be boring, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the fact that Delany has written many characters who are poets and writers.

More Classic Science Fiction Stories by Women, Yaszek identies an increasing sense of ______ feminist mode of writing in the 1970s, in contrast to many woman-authored science ction stories of the 1920s to 1960s whose politics were less deliberately signaled. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. a prudently",
    optionB: "B. an overtly",
    optionC: "C. a cordially",
    optionD: "D. an inadvertently",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Yaszek’s introduction to her science ction anthology. In this context "overtly" means openly or without concealment. The text draws a contrast between the lack of "deliberately signaled" political themes in women-authored science ction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about women-authored science ction from the 1970s. This contrast implies that the work from the 1970s did clearly reect feminist political themes. In other words, the text indicates that unlike women who wrote science ction in the 1920s to the 1960s, the women who wrote science ction in the 1970s expressed overtly feminist themes. Choice A is incorrect. In this context "prudently" would mean cautiously, which might plausibly describe the women who wrote science ction from the 1920s to the 1960s, in that they tended to avoid revealing their political views; however, the text contrasts these authors with the women writing science ction in the 1970s, thereby suggesting that the authors writing in the 1970s were not restrained in that way. Choice C is incorrect because in this context "cordially" would mean politely, and nothing in the text indicates that politeness was a signicant factor for women writing science ction either from the 1920s to the 1960s or in the 1970s. The text draws a contrast between the lack of "deliberately signaled" political themes in women-authored science ction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about women-authored science ction from the 1970s. It’s unclear how "less deliberately signaled" politics and an increasing sense of politeness toward feminism would constitute a meaningful contrast. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "inadvertently" would mean unintentionally, and nothing in the text suggests that Yaszek thought the feminist elements of the women-authored science ction from the 1970s arose without deliberate effort.',

Even signicant differences in state taxation have almost no effect on most people’s decisions, while differences in employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate are strong inuences. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. consistent with",
    optionB: "B. representative of",
    optionC: "C. overshadowed by",
    optionD: "D. irrelevant to",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the factors that inuence peoples’ decisions to move to a different state. As used in this context, “overshadowed by” means to be surpassed by or caused to seem less important than other factors affecting a move. The text indicates that, according to a US tax policy expert, when people think about an interstate move, state taxes have little effect on their decisions, while employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate have a very strong effect. This context suggests that people consider these other factors to be more important than state taxes. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that state taxes aren’t as important a consideration as other factors when people are thinking of moving to another state. The context doesn’t suggest that state taxes are “consistent with,” or in agreement with these other factors. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that state taxes are “representative of,” or typical of, other factors. Taxes aren’t an example of employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate, which are the other factors listed in the text. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that state taxes are “irrelevant to,” or unconnected or unimportant to other factors. State taxes are irrelevant to peoples’ decisions, not to other factors. In other words, although the text suggests that state taxes may be irrelevant to people considering a move to another state, the other factors mentioned in the text, such as employment opportunities, are unable to have an opinion about state taxes. Furthermore, the text indicates that signicant differences in state taxes have almost no effect on peoples’ choices to move, but they aren’t completely unimportant.",

      "The following text is adapted from Susan Glaspell’s 1912 short story “‘Out There.’” An elderly shop owner is looking at a picture that he recently acquired and hopes to sell. It did seem that the picture failed to t in with the rest of the shop. A persuasive young fellow who claimed he was closing out his stock let the old man have it for what he called a song. It was only a little out-of-the-way store which subsisted chiey on the framing of pictures. The old man looked around at his views of the city, his pictures of cats and dogs, his aming bits of landscape. “Don’t belong in here,” he fumed. And yet the old man was secretly proud of his acquisition. There was a hidden dignity in his scowling as he shued about pondering the least ridiculous place for the picture. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
    optionA:
      "A. To reveal the shop owner’s conicted feelings about the new picture",
    optionB:
      "B. To convey the shop owner’s resentment of the person he got the new picture from",
    optionC: "C. To describe the items that the shop owner most highly prizes",
    optionD:
      "D. To explain differences between the new picture and other pictures in the shop",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by stating that the new picture “failed to t in” with the other items that the shop owner has. The text goes on to illustrate that point by describing the other pictures the shop owner has, indicating that the shop owner is fuming because he doesn’t think the new picture belongs in the store. In the second paragraph, however, the text indicates that the shop owner is “secretly proud of his acquisition.” The main purpose of the text is thus to reveal the shop owner’s conicted feelings about the new picture. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the shop owner resents the young man who sold him the new picture; in fact, the text gives no indication of the owner’s feelings about the young man at all. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the new picture is different from the other items in the shop, there’s no suggestion that the shop owner prizes either the new picture or the pictures of the city, pets, and landscapes more than he prizes any other items. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe what the new picture looks like; rather, the text identies some of the other kinds of images that the shop owner has and states that they’re different from the new picture without explaining how they’re different.",

    question:
      "The people of medieval Europe have traditionally been seen as uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene, but modern research has shown that this is largely a myth. According to historian Eleanor Janega, most medieval towns in Europe had at least one public bathhouse, which often offered both full-immersion baths and—more affordably—steam baths. While such amenities were available mainly to town dwellers, regular bathing in rivers and streams or daily sponge baths at home were common practices throughout medieval Europe. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion?",
    optionA:
      "A. It asserts that in medieval Europe steam baths were more popular in rural areas than in urban ones.",
    optionB:
      "B. It describes a limitation of earlier historians’ studies of medieval European bathing habits.",
    optionC:
      "C. It concedes that not all people in medieval Europe had access to public bathhouses.",
    optionD:
      "D. It explains why Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively describes the function of the underlined portion. The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega’s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn’t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe—nor does any portion of the text. The text mentions Janega in passing, but it doesn’t go into detail about why she decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.",

    optionC: "C. respected",
    optionD: "D. prevented",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer. "Deed" means "resisted" or "deliberately disobeyed," which matches the way Klein broke from the conventions of photography in his time by including features that were generally seen as aws. Choice A is incorrect. "Reviewed" means "analyzed" or "evaluated," but that doesn’t really t the context here. Klein isn’t directly providing any thoughtful examination of the conventions of photography: he’s just breaking all the rules. Choice C is incorrect. "Respected" can mean "admired" or "followed" (as in the case of conventions). It’s clear that Klein didn’t respect conventions, given his use of photographic features that were generally considered "aws." Choice D is incorrect. "Prevented" means "stopped," and Klein did not stop the conventions—they still existed. Instead, he made images that were seen as "awed" under those conventions.',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to discuss how Derksen’s compositions incorporate elements from both Indigenous and classical music. After introducing Derksen, the text describes how the songs Derksen composed for her album Orchestral Powwow feature aspects of the two musical traditions. Specically, the text notes that Derksen wrote songs in the style of traditional powwow music but accompanied them with classical arrangements played by an orchestra that followed the beat of a powwow drum rather than the directions of a conductor.

In this context, “created” means produced. The text explains that Jeyifous, a photographer and neurobiologist, photographed adults who had appeared as children in posters from the 1970s, then combined those photographs with magnied images of the adults’ cells—a process that resulted in what he called “micro and macro portraiture.” This context suggests that Jeyifous drew on his dual interests in photography and neurobiology to produce the images for display in the exhibition.

The text states that artist and curator Joe Baker organized an exhibit that features Lenape beadwork in historical and modern works. The text describes the exhibit as "essential viewing," suggesting that it’s an important exhibit that people should make an effort to visit; this context conveys that it would be a mistake to overlook the exhibit.

      "Text 1 Some animal species, like the leopard, can be found in many kinds of areas. On the other hand, tropical mountain bird species tend to be limited in the types of spaces they can call home. This is because many mountain bird species are only able to survive at very specic elevations. Over time, these species have likely become used to living at a specic temperature. Therefore, these species struggle to survive at elevations that are warmer or colder than they are used to. Text 2 A new study reviewed observations of nearly 3,000 bird species to understand why tropical mountain bird species live at specic elevations. They noted that when a mountain bird species was found in an area with many other bird species, it tended to inhabit much smaller geographic areas. It is thus likely that competition for resources with other species, not temperature, limits where these birds can live.

    optionD:
      "D. It explains how certain birds promote seed germination in Atacama Desert soil.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The rst two sentences establish a natural phenomenon: there is a richness of plant life found in the Atacama Desert despite the hard soil that makes it challenging for seeds to germinate. The next sentence, which contains the underlined portion, offers a potential explanation for the phenomenon: local birds dig ground nests exposing seeds to moisture and materials in the soil necessary for germination. The last sentence summarizes a study that compared the fertileness of mounds of dirt dug up by birds to mounds that were undisturbed to support the explanation in the underlined portion. Thus, the underlined portion mainly functions to explain how certain birds promote seed germination in the Atacama Desert soil. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t address the topic of the soil’s tough crust or its formation. Instead, the text elaborates on the idea that local birds that build ground nests may help seeds germinate in the hard soil. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion describes how some birds may support seed germination in Atacama Desert soil but doesn’t describe how the seeds are deposited into the soil before germination begins. Choice C is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole identies a reason that a particular bird species may choose to dig ground nests in the Atacama Desert soil.",

Lights from the outside world then lled the train car as it rose out of the ground and climbed the elevated track. As long as Moss had lived in West Oakland, he’d never tired of this specic view, so he pointed toward the windows. “Check it,” he said, and the Port of Oakland began to pass by them. ©2018 by Mark Oshiro As used in the text, what does the word “specic” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Imaginary",
    optionB: "B. Energetic",
    optionC: "C. Correct",
    optionD: "D. Particular",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, "specic" most nearly means particular. The text is referring to the particular view of the Port of Oakland as seen from a subway train as it rises from underground. This specic, or particular, view has always been special to Moss, a lifetime resident of West Oakland. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text itself is a work of ction, the view is something Moss can point out to his companions on the train, so the view itself is presumably not imaginary. Choice B is incorrect. Although this view of the Port of Oakland is signicant to Moss, nothing in the text describes the view as particularly energetic as opposed to calming, for example. Choice C is incorrect. The point of the text is that the view of the Port of Oakland from the subway train as it rises from underground is signicant to Moss, not whether it is described as being correct, which the text does not address.',

Skeptical colleagues had initially suggested to Bastos that the kea’s interactions with the stones might simply be ______, but Bastos and her team showed that the kea was using the stones deliberately. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. intriguing",
    optionB: "B. obvious",
    optionC: "C. accidental",
    optionD: "D. observable",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Bastos’s study of a wild kea parrot. In this context, "accidental" means unplanned or unintentional. The text rst describes Bastos’s study, which concerns a kea that is observed using small stones to preen its feathers. The text then mentions colleagues who are skeptical (that is, they have doubt) about Bastos’s ndings, and nally describes how Bastos and her team responded to the skepticism of those colleagues. Given that the colleagues mentioned in the text expressed skepticism regarding Bastos’s ndings, the best answer choice must be one that completes the text in a manner such that the skeptics’ opinion regarding the kea’s use of stones disagrees with that held by Bastos and her team. Since Bastos and her team showed that the kea’s use of stones was deliberate (that is, intentional), the skeptics’ opinion in this context must be that the kea’s use of stones was unintentional, or accidental. Choice A is incorrect because the best answer choice is one that portrays skepticism, or doubt, of Bastos’s claim that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate, or intentional. If the skeptics found the kea’s usage of stones "intriguing," or fascinating, this would not be at odds with the position of Bastos and her team; in fact, it is reasonable to believe that someone who agreed that the kea’s stone usage was deliberate would also nd it intriguing. Choice B is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea’s usage of small stones was "obvious," or evident, this would not be contrary to the observation of Bastos and her team that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate: in fact, these opinions would be consistent with each other. Choice D is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea’s usage of small stones was "observable," or visible, this would not conict with the claim of Bastos and her team that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate: instead, these positions would agree.',

Although Lewis sculpted other subjects, her career as a sculptor is best represented by the works in which she depicted these historical and mythical themes. Text 2 Art historians have typically ignored the many portrait busts Edmonia Lewis created. Lewis likely carved these busts (sculptures of a person’s head) frequently throughout her long career. She is known for her sculptures that represent historical gures, but Lewis likely supported herself nancially by carving portrait busts for acquaintances who paid her to represent their features. Thus, Lewis’s portrait busts are a central aspect of her career as a sculptor. Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",

Francie thought that all the books in the world were in that library and she had a plan about reading all the books in the world. She was reading a book a day in alphabetical order and not skipping the dry ones. She remembered that the rst author had been Abbott. She had been reading a book a day for a long time now and she was still in the B’s. Already she had read about bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations and Byzantine architecture. For all her enthusiasm, she had to admit that some of the B’s had been hard going. But Francie was a reader. ©1947 by Betty Smith Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",

    optionC: "C. To portray Francie’s determination to meet a goal",
    optionD: "D. To describe a book that Francie greatly admires",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to portray Francie’s determination to reach her goal of reading all the books in the world. The text indicates that to achieve this aim, Francie works systematically and persistently: she reads all the books in the library in alphabetical order and devotes much time and effort to the project, nishing one book per day over a long period of time. The text then suggests that even though she progresses slowly ("she was still in the B’s") and that she struggled with some books ("some of the B’s had been hard going"), she doesn’t give up because she thinks of herself as "a reader." These details show Francie’s resolve. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) that Francie has read about, it doesn’t indicate that any of these topics are unusual or that she especially enjoyed reading about one of these topics in particular. If anything, the text suggests that she may have found some of these topics to be dull, saying that she even read the "dry ones"—that is, the boring books—and that some of the books were "hard going," meaning they were dicult to get through. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss Francie’s involvement in other activities, only her dedication to reading. Although it’s possible that Francie dedicates herself to reading because she prefers it to other activities, the text doesn’t indicate whether this is the case. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions one author (Abbott) whose book Francie has read as well as several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) she has encountered, the text doesn’t say whether Francie admires any of the books she’s read so far.

    question:
      "Text 1 Ecologists have long wondered how thousands of microscopic phytoplankton species can live together near ocean surfaces competing for the same resources. According to conventional wisdom, one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest. So why do so many species remain? Ecologists’ many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven’t uncovered a satisfactory explanation. Text 2 Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton’s diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld’s team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought. Based on the texts, how would Behrenfeld and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” discussed in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By arguing that it is based on a misconception about phytoplankton species competing with one another",
    optionB:
      "B. By asserting that it fails to recognize that routine replenishment of ocean nutrients prevents competition between phytoplankton species",
    optionC:
      "C. By suggesting that their own ndings help clarify how phytoplankton species are able to compete with larger organisms",
    optionD:
      "D. By recommending that more ecologists focus their research on how competition among phytoplankton species is increased with water density",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because based on Text 2, it represents how Behrenfeld and colleagues would most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” discussed in Text 1. The conventional wisdom cited holds the opinion that when there is species diversity within a phytoplankton population, “one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest”—that is, after being so successful in competing for resources that the other species vanish from the population. However, Text 2 explains that according to Behrenfeld and colleagues, phytoplankton are so small and spaced so far apart in the water that there is “much less” direct competition for resources within phytoplankton populations than scientists had previously thought. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses whether routine replenishment of ocean nutrients affects competition between phytoplankton species. Choice C is incorrect because the interspecies competition discussed in both texts is specically between phytoplankton species, and neither text considers whether phytoplankton compete for resources with larger nonphytoplankton species. Choice D is incorrect because according to Text 2, Behrenfeld and colleagues argue that water density decreases, not increases, competition between phytoplankton species.",

I think that will be the best plan.” It sounded like an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only diculty was, that Alice had not the smallest idea how to set about it. As used in the text, what does the word “simply” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Faintly",
    optionB: "B. Hastily",
    optionC: "C. Easily",
    optionD: "D. Foolishly",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “simply” most nearly means easily, or involving minimal diculty or effort. The text rst provides Alice’s reections on her plan to gain access to a garden and then offers commentary on her plan by the novel’s narrator. The text indicates that a reason Alice likes her plan despite not being fully thought through is that she nonetheless believes it can be eciently arranged. In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed benets of Alice’s plan is that it can be easily arranged. Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice’s plan can be arranged, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that it can be arranged “faintly,” or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little diculty. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “simply” can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word “hastily” indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice’s plan was made in haste, the text doesn’t focus on this aspect of her plan. Instead, the text focuses on the plan’s seemingly good qualities, saying that Alice thinks of it as “the best,” and the narrator refers to it as “excellent” and “neatly,” or eciently, arranged. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “simply” can mean foolishly, or lacking good sense, it doesn’t have this meaning in this context. Although the text says that Alice doesn’t know how to go about her plan, it begins by presenting her plan in a positive light: Alice describes her plan as “the best,” and the narrator refers to the plan as “excellent” and “neatly,” or eciently, arranged.",

But evolutionary links between predators and their prey can persist across centuries and continents. Around 2001, B. terrenus was introduced in southeastern North America near where botanist Shu-Mei Chang and colleagues had been monitoring mimosa trees. Within a year, 93 percent of the trees had been attacked by the beetles. Which choice best describes the function of the third sentence in the overall structure of the text?",

    optionD:
      "D. It offers an alternative explanation for the ndings of Chang and colleagues.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the third sentence within the overall structure of the text. The third sentence makes a generalization, asserting that evolutionary links between predators and prey can persist across great expanses of time and distance. This generalization is exemplied by the text’s discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and B. terrenus beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no B. terrenus beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted. When the beetles were introduced to North America more than 200 years later, however, they quickly attacked mimosa trees, illustrating the generalization that links between predators and prey "can persist across centuries and continents." Choice A is incorrect because the third sentence doesn’t indicate that Chang and colleagues were investigating any hypothesis. According to the text, Chang and colleagues were simply monitoring mimosa trees when the beetles happened to be introduced to the area. Choice C is incorrect because the third sentence doesn’t discuss any particular species, let alone the species mentioned elsewhere in the text, nor does the sentence explain why species spread to new locations. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence offers a generalization about the relationship between predators and prey, not an explanation for the ndings by Chang and colleagues that’s an "alternative" to an explanation presented elsewhere in the text.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of birdsong. In this context, "diminish" means reduce or lessen. The text establishes that birds sing to communicate over potentially large distances and that researchers believe that birds that live in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds that live in comparatively sparsely vegetated habitats. The text then explains that researchers hold this belief due to some effect of dense vegetation on the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. If birds sing to communicate over long distances, it would be logical to conclude that researchers believe that birds in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds in relatively sparse habitats do because dense vegetation diminishes the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that dense vegetation can "exceed," or surpass or go beyond, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel, not that dense vegetation goes farther than that distance. Choice C is incorrect because it would not be sensible to say that dense vegetation can "encompass," or enclose or encircle, the distance that highfrequency sounds can travel. The distance that sounds can travel is not an object that can be enclosed or encircled by vegetation. Choice D is incorrect because there is no information in the text indicating that dense vegetation can "conceal," or hide or keep from being observed, the distance that high-frequency sounds travel.

    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of using magnetism to detect stress in buried metal pipes. In this context, "exploited" means made productive use of. The text indicates that the magnetic elds of some metals change under stress and that Saleem and colleagues showed that it is possible to measure those changes from a distance, thereby demonstrating that the integrity of underground metal pipes can be evaluated without having to unearth them. This context thus indicates that Saleem and colleagues made productive use of, or exploited, this tendency of the metals’ magnetic elds. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "hypothesized" would mean made a tentative assumption to be evaluated in a study or experiment. Although Saleem and colleagues may have had one or more hypotheses for these experiments, the text presents the information about the tendency of some metals’ magnetic elds to change under stress as a known fact that the researchers made productive use of, not as a hypothesis to be evaluated. The text after the colon indicates that the researchers were not evaluating whether such changes occur but whether those changes can be measured at a distance.

Rather, the text indicates that this tendency is the basis for Saleem and colleagues’ method of assessing the pipes’ integrity. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text indicates that Saleem and colleagues "redened," or reevaluated or reformulated, the tendency of some metals’ magnetic elds to change under stress.

    optionA: "A. replicable",
    optionB: "B. predetermined",
    optionC: "C. operative",
    optionD: "D. latent",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of baleen whale accessory spleens. In this context, “latent” means dormant or functionless. The text sets up a contrast between the idea that baleen whale accessory spleens appear not to have a function and the research indicating that the accessory spleen may actually have a role in supporting the whales’ diving mechanisms. This context therefore conveys the idea that the assumption that baleen whale accessory spleens are latent may be incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the role of the accessory spleen is “replicable,” or capable of being reproduced. The text indicates that the role of the accessory spleen seems to have no function, but some researchers think it does have a role; the text doesn’t address whether the role of the accessory spleen could or couldn’t be reproduced. Choice B is incorrect because suggesting that the role of the accessory spleen is “predetermined,” or decided in advance, wouldn’t make sense in context. Although the researchers may agree that the role of the accessory spleen or any other organ hasn’t been determined in advance, the text focuses on the idea that the accessory spleen was thought to have been functionless but may in fact serve an active role for baleen whales. Choice C is incorrect because it’s the opposite of what the context of the text is conveying. The second sentence of the text indicates that baleen whale accessory spleens may not be useless, not that they aren’t “operative,” or functional.",

Because Xoconochco’s location within the empire was so ______, cacao and other trade goods produced there could reach the capital only after a long overland journey. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. unobtrusive",
    optionB: "B. concealed",
    optionC: "C. approximate",
    optionD: "D. peripheral",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the location of the province of Xoconochco within the Aztec Empire. As used in this context, “peripheral” means situated toward the outer bounds rather than the center. The text indicates that Xoconochco was located on a coast, hundreds of kilometers away from the capital of the Aztec Empire. The text also states that trade between the province and the capital required “a long overland journey.” This context suggests that Xoconochco was situated toward an edge of the empire’s territory rather than near its center. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to refer to Xoconochco’s location within the Aztec Empire as “unobtrusive,” or not blatant or undesirably prominent; it’s not clear how a province’s physical location would or wouldn’t be blatant. Instead of focusing on how noticeable Xoconochco’s location was, the text emphasizes the province’s distance from the capital of the empire, pointing out that because of this distance trade between the two required “a long overland journey.” Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the province of Xoconochco was located on a coast far from the capital of the Aztec Empire, not that it was “concealed,” or kept out of sight or hidden from view. Nothing in the text suggests that Xoconochco was actually hidden such that people couldn’t see it, and being hidden wouldn’t necessarily result in trade between the province and the capital requiring “a long overland journey.” Choice C is incorrect because to say that Xoconochco’s location within the Aztec Empire was “approximate” would mean that the location either wasn’t precisely correct or was close to some other location. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text indicates that Xoconochco’s location is known and that it was far from the empire’s capital, so there’s no reason to characterize the location as either not precisely correct or close to another location.",

      "K.D. Leka and colleagues found that the Sun’s corona provides an advance indication of solar ares—intense eruptions of electromagnetic radiation that emanate from active regions in the Sun’s photosphere and can interfere with telecommunications on Earth. Preceding a are, the corona temporarily exhibits increased brightness above the region where the are is ______. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. antecedent",
    optionB: "B. impending",
    optionC: "C. innocuous",
    optionD: "D. perpetual",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of advance indications of solar ares. In this context the word "impending" means imminent or approaching. The text mentions a study by Leka and colleagues that found that the Sun’s corona provides an advance indication of solar ares. The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful—solar ares can interfere with communications on Earth—and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar are. The text indicates that this characteristic—increased brightness in a particular region of the corona—comes before the appearance of the are. Therefore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the are is approaching, or impending. Choice A is incorrect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun’s corona precedes the appearance of the are. But if the are were "antecedent," or previous, then the are would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word "innocuous," or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar ares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorrect. If the solar ares have an advance indication of their appearance, then there must therefore be a time before the appearance of the ares when they do not exist. But the word "perpetual," or never-ending, would in context indicate that the are exists at the same time as the advance indication provided by the Sun’s corona, which would not make logical sense.',

    question:
      "Text 1 An excavation in Chiquihuite Cave in central Mexico has upended the belief that approximately 13,000 years ago, a group known as the Clovis people were the rst human inhabitants of North America. More than 200 crude stone tools were found embedded in a layer of earth that is up to 33,150 years old, revealing that humans occupied the cave thousands of years before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2 The objects uncovered in Chiquihuite Cave are intriguing, but it is premature to characterize them as tools. The stone pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply fractured from rocks during natural geological activity in the cave. Moreover, their unearthing has thus far not been accompanied by discoveries of other signs of human activity or even traces of human DNA from surfaces. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By suggesting that it draws a plausible connection between two groups of people but will need to be conrmed with further study",
    optionB:
      "B. By asserting that it rests on an assumption about the stone pieces that is not suciently supported by available evidence",
    optionC:
      "C. By acknowledging that it will most likely be proved correct when the stone pieces undergo more detailed analysis",
    optionD:
      "D. By pointing out that it fails to account for evidence that the Clovis people were active on the continent as early as is commonly thought",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim about the Clovis people in Text 1. Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clovis people were the rst human inhabitants of North America has been overturned by the unearthing of stone tools in Chiquihuite Cave in Mexico. The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old—much older than the Clovis people’s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are denitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces—that they are human-made tools—that is not suciently supported by available evidence. Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn’t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group’s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn’t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be conrmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group’s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent’s rst inhabitants. Therefore, there’s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought.",

    optionA: "A. preventable",
    optionB: "B. undeniable",
    optionC: "C. common",
    optionD: "D. concerning",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how biodiversity loss due to invasive species can be avoided. As used in this context, “preventable” means able to be stopped or kept from happening. The text indicates that “people can take simple steps” to avoid bringing possible invasive species into new environments. It presents these steps as an example of how biodiversity loss due to invasive species is preventable. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that a simple step like washing your shoes after traveling is an example of biodiversity loss due to invasive species being “undeniable,” or something that can’t be proved to be wrong. Although the text may suggest that biodiversity loss due to invasive species is something that really happens, the word that completes the text must make the rst sentence into an assertion that is illustrated by the second sentence, and the second sentence illustrates the idea that biodiversity loss due to invasive species is preventable, not undeniable. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that a simple step like washing your shoes after traveling is an example of biodiversity loss due to invasive species being “common,” or something that happens regularly. Additionally, the text doesn’t provide any information about how frequently invasive species cause biodiversity loss. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that a simple step like washing your shoes after traveling is an example of biodiversity loss due to invasive species being “concerning,” or something that is troubling or causes worry.

    question:
      "Text 1 A team led by Bernardo Strassburg has found that rewilding farmland (returning the land to its natural state) could help preserve biodiversity and offset carbon emissions. The amount of farmland that would need to be restored, they found, is remarkably low. Rewilding a mere 15% of the world’s current farmland would prevent 60% of expected species extinctions and help absorb nearly 299 gigatons of carbon dioxide—a clear win in the ght against the biodiversity and climate crises. Text 2 While Strassburg’s team’s ndings certainly offer encouraging insight into the potential benets of rewilding, it’s important to consider potential effects on global food supplies. The researchers suggest that to compensate for the loss of food-producing land, remaining farmland would need to produce even more food. Thus, policies focused on rewilding farmland must also address strategies for higher-yield farming. Which choice best describes a difference in how the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 view Strassburg’s team’s study?",
    optionA:
      "A. The author of Text 2 approaches the study’s ndings with some caution, whereas the author of Text 1 is optimistic about the reported potential environmental\nbenets.",
    optionB:
      "B. The author of Text 2 claims that the percentage of farmland identied by Strassburg’s team is too low for rewilding to achieve meaningful results, whereas the\nauthor of Text 1 thinks the percentage is sucient.",
    optionC:

    optionD:
      "D. The author of Text 2 focuses on rewilding’s effect on carbon emissions, whereas the author of Text 1 focuses on its effect on biodiversity.",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer. Text 1 is extremely positive about Strassburg’s team’s ndings, calling the potential results "a clear win in the ght against the biodiversity and climate crises." Text 2 is not as positive, arguing that while the ndings point to "potential benets," we also need to consider the "potential effects on global food supplies." Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t a difference between the two views. Text 1 does present the 15% number as enough to achieve meaningful results, but that’s not what Text 2 takes issue with: rather, Text 2 argues that we need to consider the effect that rewilding this much farmland would have on food supplies. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t a difference between the two views. Neither text mentions the timeline for achieving the results described by Strassburg’s team. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t a difference between the two views. Text 1 focuses on rewilding’s effects on both carbon emissions and biodiversity. Text 2 doesn’t focus on rewilding’s effect on carbon emissions at all.

      "Text 1 In 1954 George Balanchine choreographed a production of The Nutcracker, a ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It has since become a tradition for hundreds of dance companies in North America to stage The Nutcracker each year. But the show is stuck in the past, with an old-fashioned story and references, so it should no longer be produced. Ballet needs to create new traditions if it wants to stay relevant to contemporary audiences. Text 2 The Nutcracker is outdated, but it should be kept because it’s a holiday favorite and provides substantial income for some dance companies. Although it can be behind the times, there are creative ways to update the show. For example, Debbie Allen successfully modernized the story. Her show Hot Chocolate Nutcracker combines ballet, tap, hip-hop, and other styles, and it has been gaining in popularity since it opened in 2009. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?",
    optionA:
      "A. By questioning the idea that the story of The Nutcracker is stuck in the past and by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an\nupdated version",
    optionB:
      "B. By agreeing that contemporary audiences have largely stopped going to see performances of The Nutcracker because it’s so old-fashioned",

    optionD:
      "D. By suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'Choice D is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 begins by noting the success of The Nutcracker but then claims that the ballet is "stuck in the past" and should "no longer be produced." Text 2 begins by conceding that The Nutcracker is indeed outdated but argues that it should continue to be performed, states that the show can be updated to include more contemporary dance styles, and provides an example of one such modernized version, Hot Chocolate Nutcracker. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 advocates for using creative ways to update The Nutcracker and therefore wouldn’t respond to the underlined claim by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version. Choice B is incorrect because although the authors of both texts claim that The Nutcracker is outdated, neither text suggests that contemporary audiences have largely stopped attending productions of the show. On the contrary, Text 2 states that The Nutcracker is a holiday favorite and generates substantial income for some dance companies. Choice C is incorrect because although Text 2 provides an example of a contemporized version of The Nutcracker, the text doesn’t suggest that offering modernized versions is a way to increase income for most dance companies. Rather, the author of Text 2 suggests that offering modernized versions is a way to make the ballet discussed in Text 1 feel less outdated.',

      "Text 1 Dominique Potvin and colleagues captured ve Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) to test a new design for attaching tracking devices to birds. As the researchers tted each magpie with a tracker attached by a small harness, they noticed some magpies without trackers pecking at another magpie’s tracker until it broke off. The researchers suggest that this behavior could be evidence of magpies attempting to help another magpie without beneting themselves. Text 2 It can be tempting to think that animals are deliberately providing help when we see them removing trackers and other equipment from one another, especially when a species is known to exhibit other cooperative behaviors. At the same time, it can be dicult to exclude the possibility that individuals are simply interested in the equipment because of its novelty, curiously pawing or pecking at it until it detaches. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the researchers’ perspective in Text 1 on the behavior of the magpies without trackers?",
    optionA:
      "A. That behavior might have been due to the novelty of the magpies’ captive setting rather than to the novelty of the tracker.",
    optionB:
      "B. That behavior likely indicates that the magpies were deliberately attempting to benet themselves by obtaining the tracker.",
    optionC:
      "C. That behavior may not be evidence of selessness in Gymnorhina tibicen because not all the captured magpies demonstrated it.",
    optionD:
      "D. That behavior might be adequately explained without suggesting that the magpies were attempting to assist the other magpie.",
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Choice D is the best answer because it reects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the researchers’ perspective in Text 1 on the behavior of the magpies without trackers. According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benet to themselves. Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other. The text cautions that it shouldn’t be assumed that these animals are helping one another deliberately, since they might simply be pecking at trackers out of curiosity, causing them to fall off eventually. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues’ perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses the novelty, or the newness and unusual quality, of the captive settings in which animals have been observed to remove trackers from other animals, nor does it suggest that such novelty might account for this behavior. Instead, the text suggests that it’s the novelty of the tracking equipment itself that might cause the behavior: interested in the trackers because they’re unusual, animals might paw or peck at them until they fall off. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never suggests that when animals remove trackers from other animals, they do so because they wish to obtain the trackers for themselves. Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as seless only if all of them participate in it. Instead, the text argues that the behavior may not be seless at all and may instead be attributed to animals’ curiosity about the new and unusual trackers.",

      "Text 1 Polar bears sustain themselves primarily by hunting seals on the Arctic sea ice, but rising ocean temperatures are causing the ice to diminish, raising concerns about polar bear population declines as these large predators’ seal-hunting habitats continue to shrink. A 2020 study examining polar bear populations across the Arctic concluded that populations affected by sea-ice loss are at great risk of extinction by the end of the twenty-rst century. Text 2 Monitoring carried out by researchers from the Norwegian Polar Institute shows that the polar bear population on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard remains stable and well nourished despite rapidly declining sea ice in recent years. The researchers attribute this population’s resilience in part to a shift in feeding strategies: in addition to hunting seals, the Svalbard polar bears have begun relying on a diet of reindeer meat and birds’ eggs. Based on the texts, how would the researchers in Text 2 most likely respond to the conclusion presented in the underlined portion of Text 1?",

    optionD:
      "D. By arguing that it fails to account for polar bears’ reliance on a single seal-hunting strategy",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Choice A is the best answer. Text 2 describes how the Svalbard polar bears have adapted to the loss of sea ice by diversifying their diet and feeding on reindeer and seabird eggs, resulting in a “stable and well nourished” population despite environmental challenges. This counters the underlined claim that polar bears facing a loss of sea ice are at “great risk of extinction” by the end of the century. Choice B is incorrect. Text 2 does not challenge the fact that sea ice is rapidly declining in the Arctic due to warming ocean temperatures. In fact, it states that the Svalbard polar bears have faced “rapidly declining sea ice in recent years.” Choice C is incorrect. The claim in Text 1 is specic to polar bear populations affected by the loss of seal hunting habitats, so unaffected populations are irrelevant to the claim. Also, Text 2 doesn’t mention any polar bear populations that haven’t yet been affected by loss of seal hunting habitats. It focuses on a population that has been affected by sea-ice loss but has managed to survive and thrive nevertheless. Choice D is incorrect. Text 2 doesn’t imply that polar bears rely on a single seal-hunting strategy.

    optionD: "D. repressed by",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of the artist Diego Velázquez’s inuence outside Spain. As used in this context, “conned to” means restricted to. The text says that Velázquez was the leading artist in the Spanish court during the seventeenth century, but it also notes that other painters around the world were inuenced by his techniques and style. Thus, Velázquez’s inuence was hardly (or almost not) conned to, or restricted to, Spain. Choice A is incorrect because if Velázquez was a leading artist in Spain, it doesn’t make logical sense to claim that his inuence was hardly (or almost not) derived from, or obtained from, Spain. Moreover, the other painters around the world who employed Velázquez’s techniques would by denition be inuenced by Spanish style. Choice B is incorrect because if Velázquez was a leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, then his inuence must have been widely recognized, or acknowledged, rather than being hardly (or almost not) recognized. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that deliberately limiting Velázquez’s inuence outside Spain was ever considered by anyone.

    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is to make a case for the importance of Scott Joplin’s less famous works. The text begins by introducing Joplin’s most popular works and then goes on to assert that gaining a full understanding of Joplin’s creativity requires a consideration of his lesser-known pieces as well. The text concludes by characterizing the lesser-known works "Pleasant Moments" and Treemonisha as masterpieces that deserve to be famous.

    question:
      "Latro, the main character of Gene Wolfe’s novel Soldier of the Mist, is a man in ancient Greece. He completely loses his memory whenever he sleeps. So, before sleeping, Latro records the important experiences of each day on a scroll, carefully choosing which ones to ______. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. suspect",
    optionB: "B. preserve",
    optionC: "C. suggest",
    optionD: "D. imagine",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text about Latro, the main character in Gene Wolfe’s novel Soldier of the Mist. In this context, "preserve" means save or keep from destruction or loss. The text describes Latro as a character who loses his memory whenever he sleeps. The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them. The context therefore supports the idea that Latro records his most important experiences in an effort to save, or preserve, his memory of them from loss. Choice A is incorrect because "suspect" would mean mistrust, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "suggest" would mean propose for consideration. The text emphasizes the fact that Latro actually records those experiences that he has decided are most important to him, not that he merely proposes which experiences to consider for inclusion in his scroll. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "imagine" would either mean form a mental image of or fabricate, neither of which would logically complete the text. Although it’s possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down. In a similar vein, the text emphasizes that Latro is recording experiences that have actually happened to him, not that he’s fabricating the experiences he records.',

    question:
      "The following text is adapted from Mercedes de Acosta’s 1921 poem “Spring and You.” Now, Love and April, and the gold of your hair, Are all mingled together Like the blending of an exotic dream plant With the fragrant perfume of a strange, frail ower. As used in the text, what does the word “mingled” most nearly mean?",
    optionA: "A. Identied",
    optionB: "B. Combined",
    optionC: "C. Remembered",
    optionD: "D. Celebrated",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, "mingled" most nearly means combined. In the text, the speaker refers to several concepts mingling together and then compares this to "the blending of" two other things (an exotic plant and the fragrance of a strange ower). This comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts of love, April, and the gold of someone’s hair as being blended together, or combined. Choice A is incorrect because "mingled" means combined, not identied. The speaker names several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) and then moves to a comparison of their mingling together to "the blending of" a plant and the scent of a ower, conveying the idea that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined. Choice C is incorrect. The text as a whole may refer to a memory, but the comparison of the mingling of several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) to "the blending of" a plant and the scent of a ower conveys that the speaker views those concepts as actually blended together, or combined, and not simply remembered at the same time. Choice D is incorrect. The speaker refers to several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) and then compares the mingling together of those concepts to "the blending of" a plant and the scent of a ower; rather than suggesting that the concepts are celebrated, this comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined.',

    question:
      "The following text is from Annie Dillard’s 1987 autobiographical novel An American Childhood. The narrator is a young girl living in Pittsburgh. I walked. My mother had given me the freedom of the streets as soon as I could say our telephone number. I walked and memorized the neighborhood. I made a mental map and located myself upon it. At night in bed I rehearsed the small world’s scheme and set challenges: Find the store using backyards only. Imagine a route from the school to my friend’s house. ©1987 by Annie Dillard Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?",
    optionA:
      "A. It describes the narrator trying to memorize her telephone number.",
    optionB:
      "B. It provides examples of what the narrator thinks about at night.",
    optionC: "C. It gives directions to the narrator’s favorite local store.",
    optionD: "D. It portrays the narrator’s relationship with her mother.",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Choice B is the best answer because it accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. In the text, the narrator explains that she walks around her neighborhood, making a "mental map" of the area that she imagines herself navigating through. She then states that she rehearses "the small world’s scheme"—that is, imagines moving through her mental map—and challenges herself to use the map in her mind while lying in bed at night. The underlined portion presents two such challenges (getting to the store through backyards and traveling from school to a friend’s house) and thus provides examples of what the narrator thinks about at night. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion makes no mention of memorizing a telephone number. Although the narrator mentions that she had to learn the home telephone number before her mother would give her permission to walk around the neighborhood, there is nothing in the underlined portion or the rest of the text about memorizing the telephone number. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion refers to navigation tasks like nding a route to a store only through backyards, the text contains no specic directions to any store, nor is any store identied as the narrator’s favorite. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion makes no mention of the narrator’s mother and doesn’t address the narrator’s relationship with her. Although the narrator mentions that her mother gave her permission as a child to walk around the neighborhood, there is nothing in the underlined portion or the rest of the text about the mother or her relationship to her child.',

    question:
      "As an undergraduate researcher in anthropology, Jennifer C. Chen contributed to a groundbreaking study challenging the accepted view that among prehistoric peoples, female participation in hunting was ______. The research team’s review of data from late Pleistocene and early Holocene burials in the Americas revealed that, in fact, as many as half of the hunters in those populations were female. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. inevitable",
    optionB: "B. satisfactory",
    optionC: "C. negligible",
    optionD: "D. commonplace",
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the study of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. In this context, “negligible” means not signicant enough to be worth considering. The text says that the study challenged the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. The text goes on to say that the researchers found that “in fact, as many as half” the hunters in the groups studied were female. The phrase “in fact” establishes a contrast indicating that the nding that as many as half the hunters were female differs from the accepted view. This context suggests, then, that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was negligible. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among prehistoric peoples were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was “inevitable,” or unavoidable. Nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view is that prehistoric peoples could not avoid female participation in hunting. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples is that such participation was “satisfactory,” or sucient to meet a requirement or demand. There is no information in the text about any demands or requirements regarding female participation in hunting, let alone any information about how much female participation in hunting would be enough to satisfy those demands or requirements. Instead, the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half the hunters in the groups studied were female, suggesting that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was low. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among the prehistoric peoples studied were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was “commonplace,” or ordinary or unremarkable. Although the study under discussion suggests that female participation may have been commonplace, that study is presented as challenging the accepted view, not as reinforcing the accepted view.",

    question:
      "The artisans of the Igun Eronmwon guild in Benin City, Nigeria, typically ______ the bronze- and brass-casting techniques that have been passed down through their families since the thirteenth century, but they don’t strictly observe every tradition; for example, guild members now use air-conditioning motors instead of handheld bellows to help heat their forges. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    optionA: "A. experiment with",
    optionB: "B. adhere to",
    optionC: "C. improve on",
    optionD: "D. grapple with",
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of bronze- and brass-casting techniques used by the Igun Eronmwon guild. In this context “adhere to” would mean to act in accordance with. The text states that although members of the Igun Eronmwon guild typically do something with techniques that have been passed down since the thirteenth century, they “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” By establishing a contrast with not always following traditions, the context suggests that guild members do typically adhere to traditional techniques. Choice A is incorrect because in this context “experiment with” would mean to do something new with. Although using motors rather than manual bellows is presented as a new approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” The phrase “experiment with” wouldn’t support the contrast because regularly trying new things with the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “improve on” would mean to make better. Although using motors rather than manual bellows might be an improved approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” The phrase “improve on” wouldn’t support the contrast because regularly making changes to the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “grapple with” would mean to try hard to solve a dicult problem. Although bronze- and brass-casting are likely challenging tasks, nothing in the text suggests that the guild members have any particular diculties with the techniques passed down since the thirteenth century.",

    question:
      "Ronyoung Kim creatively captures the Korean American immigrant experience in her novel Clay Walls by writing about a family from three ______ perspectives. The rst section of the novel is from the mother Haesu’s perspective, the second is from the father Chun’s perspective, and the last is from the daughter Faye’s perspective. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word?",
    optionA: "A. distinct",
    optionB: "B. required",
    optionC: "C. unintended",
    optionD: "D. unknown",
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ronyoung Kim’s novel Clay Walls. In this context, "distinct" means clearly separate and different. The text indicates that the novel consists of three sections and that each section is narrated from the perspective of a different character. This context supports the idea that Kim’s novel features three distinct perspectives. Choice B is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as "required," or demanded as necessary to be done or provided, wouldn’t make sense in context. When writing a novel, a novelist is free to choose to narrate the story from any number of perspectives. There’s nothing in the text to indicate that providing three perspectives was demanded of Kim. Instead, the text focuses on identifying the three different perspectives featured in Kim’s novel. Choice C is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as "unintended," or not planned as a purpose or goal, wouldn’t make sense in context. Authors make deliberate choices about the perspectives they feature in their works, and the text indicates that Kim chose to incorporate three different perspectives in her novel. Choice D is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as "unknown," or not revealed, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text directly identies the three perspectives that appear in her novel as those of Faye and her two parents, Haesu and Chun, which indicates that the novel’s perspectives are in fact known.',
